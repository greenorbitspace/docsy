description: The UK Cyber Essentials Framework outlines technical controls, definitions,
  and scope for IT infrastructure assessment and certification, emphasizing the importance
  of including all devices and software in scope for optimal security and customer
  confidence.

# A. Introducing the technical controls

...................................................................................................... 3 



# B. Definitions 

- Software includes operating systems, commercial off-the-shelf applications, plugins, interpreters, scripts, libraries, network software and firewall and router firmware.

- Devices includes all types of hosts, networking equipment, servers, networks, and end user devices such as desktop computers, laptop computers, thin clients, tablets and smartphones — whether physical or virtual.

- Applicant refers to your organisation which is seeking certification, or sometimes the individual who is acting as the main point of contact, depending on context.

- A corporate VPN is a virtual private network that connects back to your office location, or to a virtual or cloud firewall. You must administer the VPN so you can apply the firewall controls. 

- Organisational data includes any electronic data belonging to your organisation, for example, emails, documents, database data, financial data.

- Organisational service includes any software applications, cloud applications, cloud services, user interactive desktops and mobile device management (MDM) solutions that your organisation owns or subscribes to. For example: web applications, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, mobile device management containers, Citrix Desktop, Virtual Desktop solutions or IP telephony.

- A sub-set is part of the organisation whose network is segregated from the rest of the organisation by a firewall or VLAN.

- Servers are devices that provide organisational data or services to other devices as part of your organisation’s business.

- Licensed and supported software is software that you have a legal right to use and that a vendor has committed to support by providing regular updates or patches. The vendor must provide the future date when they will stop providing updates. (Note that the vendor doesn’t need to have created the software originally, but they must be able to now modify the original software to create updates). 

# C. Scope 

## Scope overview

Your assessment and certification should cover the whole of the IT infrastructure used to carry out your organisation’s business, or if necessary, a well-defined and separately managed sub-set. Either way, you must clearly define the scope boundary, namely: the business unit managing it, the network boundary and physical location. You must agree the scope with the certification body before assessment begins. 

A sub-set can be used to define what is in scope or what is out of scope for your Cyber Essentials certification. 

Please note: Organisations that choose a scope which includes their whole IT infrastructure achieve the best protection and maximise their customers' confidence. The requirements apply to all devices and software in scope and which meet any of these conditions:

- can accept incoming network connections from untrusted internet-connected hosts m

- can establish user-initiated outbound connections to devices via the internet

- control the flow of data between any of the above devices and the internet. 

A scope that doesn’t include end-user devices isn’t acceptable.
