# 1. Introduction

At Green Orbit Digital, we understand that employees may occasionally be unable to work due to illness or injury. This policy outlines our procedures for managing sickness absence and supporting employees in their return to work.

## 2. Notification of Sickness

Employees must notify their immediate supervisor or HR of any absence due to illness by 9:30 AM on each day of absence. Notification should be made via phone, email, or approved communication channels.

## 3. Short-Term Sickness

For absences up to 7 days, employees must complete a self-certification form documenting their illness. Enhanced sick pay of full salary is provided for up to 10 days per year, subject to proper notification and documentation.

## 4. Long-Term Sickness

For absences exceeding 7 days, a doctor's note is mandatory. Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) will be provided according to current regulations. The company will maintain regular contact with employees on long-term sick leave to provide support and discuss return-to-work arrangements.

## 5. Return to Work Process

- Complete return-to-work documentation

- Attend a return-to-work meeting with supervisor or HR

- Review workload and priorities

## 6. Support and Adjustments

The company will consider reasonable adjustments to support employees returning to work, which may include:

- Phased return to work

- Modified duties or working hours

- Additional training or support

## 7. Policy Review

This policy will be reviewed periodically to ensure its effectiveness and compliance with current legislation and best practices.
