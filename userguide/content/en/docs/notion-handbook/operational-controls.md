## Operational Controls for Environmental Management

### 1. Waste Management Controls

- Implement waste segregation procedures for different types of waste streams

- Establish proper storage and disposal methods for hazardous materials

- Maintain waste tracking logs and documentation

### 2. Energy Conservation Controls

- Monitor and track energy consumption patterns

- Implement energy-efficient practices in facilities and operations

- Regular maintenance of equipment to ensure optimal energy performance

### 3. Water Management Controls

- Monitor water usage and implement conservation measures

- Establish procedures for preventing water contamination

- Regular maintenance of water systems and leak detection

### 4. Air Emission Controls

- Monitor and control air emissions from operations

- Maintain emission control equipment and systems

- Regular testing and documentation of air quality parameters

### 5. Chemical Management Controls

- Proper storage and handling procedures for chemicals

- Maintain updated Safety Data Sheets (SDS)

- Regular inspection of chemical storage areas

### 6. Emergency Response Controls

- Establish emergency preparedness and response procedures

- Regular emergency response drills and training

- Maintain emergency response equipment and supplies

### 7. Documentation and Reporting
