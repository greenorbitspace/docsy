## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Backup Policy is to ensure that information and critical systems at [Organisation Name] are protected against loss, corruption, or destruction through the implementation of effective and consistent backup and recovery procedures.

This policy supports the organisation’s compliance with ISO/IEC 27001 requirements for information security and business continuity.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

- All information assets, systems, servers, databases, applications, cloud services, and network devices owned, operated, or managed by [Organisation Name].

- All employees, contractors, and third parties who are responsible for data handling or backup operations.

- All data classified as Critical, Confidential, or Internal under the Information Classification Policy.

## 3. Definitions

- Backup: A copy of data stored separately from the original to enable recovery in case of loss or corruption.

- Critical Data: Data necessary for the organisation’s operational continuity, compliance, or financial obligations.

- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): The maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time.

- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): The maximum acceptable amount of time to restore systems after disruption.

## 4. Policy

### 4.1 Backup Responsibilities

- The Information Security Manager and IT Department are responsible for implementing, maintaining, monitoring, and testing backups.

- Data Owners must ensure that critical business data within their remit is identified and included in backup plans.

### 4.2 Data to be Backed Up

- Critical business data, including databases, document management systems, user files, configurations, and cloud service data.

- System configuration files and documentation necessary for system recovery.

- Logs required for audit, compliance, and forensic investigations.

### 4.3 Backup Frequency and Retention

- Daily incremental backups must be performed for all critical systems.

- Full backups must be performed at least weekly.

- Backup retention periods must be defined according to the data classification and legal, regulatory, or contractual requirements:

### 4.4 Backup Storage

- Backups must be stored securely using encryption, both at rest and during transmission.

- At least one backup copy must be stored offsite or in a separate cloud region to protect against physical disasters.

- Access to backup media must be restricted to authorised personnel only.

- Backup media must be labelled clearly, and media rotation schedules must be established.

### 4.5 Backup Security

- All backups must be protected from unauthorised access, alteration, theft, or destruction.

- Backup encryption keys must be securely stored and managed according to the Key Management Policy.

- Media disposal must be performed securely, using methods appropriate to the sensitivity of the information (e.g., shredding, degaussing, secure wiping).

### 4.6 Testing and Verification

- Backups must be tested at least quarterly to verify the ability to restore data and systems successfully.

- Recovery testing must include both partial (file-level) and full-system recovery tests.

- Testing results must be documented and reviewed by the Information Security Manager.

### 4.7 Cloud and SaaS Backup

- Data stored in Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platforms must be protected by verified backup processes, either through the provider's backup services or independent solutions.

- Cloud services must be evaluated for their backup and disaster recovery capabilities during procurement and vendor assessment.

### 4.8 Incident Response

- In the event of data loss, backups must be used to restore information to meet RPO and RTO targets defined in the Business Continuity Plan.

- Backup failures must be logged as security incidents and investigated.

### 4.9 Documentation

- Detailed backup schedules, procedures, media inventories, recovery procedures, and backup testing results must be maintained and regularly reviewed.

- A Backup Register must be maintained, listing all systems and data included in backups, backup locations, frequency, and responsible persons.

### 4.10 Training and Awareness

- Staff involved in backup operations must receive appropriate training to understand backup processes, security requirements, and recovery procedures.

- General security awareness training for all employees must include the importance of data protection and backup integrity.

## 5. Exceptions

Any exceptions to this policy must be formally documented and authorised by the Information Security Manager following a risk assessment.

## 6. Enforcement

Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination, and may involve legal penalties where applicable.
