title: Zoom Lens Imaging
ref: zoom-lens-imaging
description: A zoom lens is a type of camera lens that allows the photographer to
  change the focal length, enabling them to zoom in on a subject or zoom out to capture
  a wider scene without changing the lens. This versatility makes zoom lenses popular
  among photographers for various types of photography, including landscapes, portraits,
  and wildlife.
