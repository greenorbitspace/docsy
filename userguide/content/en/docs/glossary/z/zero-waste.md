title: Zero Waste
ref: zero-waste
description: Zero Waste is a waste management philosophy that encourages the redesign
  of resource life cycles so that all products are reused. The goal is to minimize
  waste and promote sustainability by reducing the amount of materials sent to landfills
  and incinerators, ultimately striving for a closed-loop system where all materials
  are recycled or composted.
