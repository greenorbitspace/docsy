definition: A "just transition" refers to the process of transitioning to a sustainable
  economy in a way that is fair and equitable for all stakeholders, particularly those
  affected by the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. This approach
  aims to ensure that workers, communities, and vulnerable populations are supported
  and included in the transition, minimizing negative impacts and promoting social
  justice.
