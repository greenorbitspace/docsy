definition: Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is a process that involves
  generating energy from biomass while capturing and storing the carbon dioxide emissions
  produced during the energy generation process. This technology aims to reduce greenhouse
  gas emissions and contribute to climate change mitigation by combining renewable
  energy production with carbon management strategies.
