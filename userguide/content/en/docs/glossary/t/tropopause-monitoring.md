definition: The tropopause is the boundary layer between the troposphere and the stratosphere
  in the Earth's atmosphere. It is characterized by a temperature inversion, where
  the temperature stops decreasing with altitude and begins to increase. This layer
  plays a crucial role in weather patterns and the dispersion of pollutants.
