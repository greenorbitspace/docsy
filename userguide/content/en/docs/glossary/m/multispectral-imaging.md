definition: Multispectral imaging is a technique that captures image data at specific
  wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum. This method allows for the analysis
  and interpretation of various materials and surfaces by detecting the reflected
  light in multiple spectral bands, which can reveal information not visible to the
  human eye.
