title: Multispectral Imaging
ref: multispectral-imaging
description: Multispectral imaging is a technique that captures image data at specific
  wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum. This allows for the analysis of
  materials and objects based on their spectral signatures, providing valuable insights
  in various fields such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing.
