title: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (Ndvi)
ref: normalized-difference-vegetation-index-ndvi
description: The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a remote sensing
  measurement used to assess vegetation health and cover by comparing the difference
  between near-infrared and red light reflected by plants. NDVI values range from
  -1 to 1, where higher values indicate healthier and denser vegetation.
