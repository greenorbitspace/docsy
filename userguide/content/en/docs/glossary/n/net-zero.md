definition: Net zero refers to the balance between the amount of greenhouse gas emissions
  produced and the amount removed from the atmosphere. Achieving net zero means that
  any emissions released are counteracted by an equivalent amount of emissions being
  taken out of the atmosphere, typically through measures such as reforestation, carbon
  capture, or reducing energy consumption.
