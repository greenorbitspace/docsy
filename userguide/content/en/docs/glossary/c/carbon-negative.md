ref: carbon-negative
description: Carbon negative refers to a state in which an individual, organization,
  or activity removes more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it emits, resulting

  methods, such as reforestation, carbon capture technologies, and sustainable practices
  that promote a lower carbon footprint.
