definition: Atmospheric correction is a process used in remote sensing to adjust the
  data collected by sensors to account for atmospheric effects that can distort the
  signal received from the Earth's surface. This correction helps improve the accuracy
  of the measurements and provides a clearer representation of the surface features
  being analyzed.
