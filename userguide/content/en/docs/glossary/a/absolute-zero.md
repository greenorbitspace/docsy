ref: absolute-zero
description: Absolute zero is the lowest temperature possible, at which a thermodynamic
  system has minimal energy, typically defined as 0 Kelvin, -273.15 degrees Celsius,
  or -459.67 degrees Fahrenheit. At this temperature, the motion of atoms theoretically
  comes to a complete stop.
