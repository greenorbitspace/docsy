title: Aerosol Optical Depth
ref: aerosol-optical-depth
description: Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a measure of the extinction of solar light
  by aerosol particles in the atmosphere. It quantifies how much sunlight is prevented
  from reaching the ground due to the presence of aerosols, such as dust, smoke, and
  pollution. AOD values are used in various fields, including climate science, atmospheric
  studies, and remote sensing.
