definition: Atmospheric composition refers to the various gases and particles that
  make up the Earth's atmosphere. The primary components include nitrogen (about 78%),
  oxygen (about 21%), and trace amounts of other gases such as argon, carbon dioxide,
  and water vapor. Understanding atmospheric composition is crucial for studying climate,
  weather patterns, and air quality.
