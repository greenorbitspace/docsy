title: Passive Remote Sensing
ref: passive-remote-sensing
description: Passive remote sensing refers to the technique of collecting data by
  detecting natural radiation that is emitted or reflected by objects on the Earth's
  surface. Unlike active remote sensing, which relies on an external source of energy
  (like a radar or laser), passive remote sensing utilizes sunlight or thermal radiation
  to capture information about the environment, such as temperature, vegetation cover,
  and land use.
