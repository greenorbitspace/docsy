ref: paris-aligned
description: A Paris-aligned approach refers to strategies and actions taken by individuals,
  organizations, or governments that aim to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement,

  This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy
  sources, and implementing sustainable practices.
