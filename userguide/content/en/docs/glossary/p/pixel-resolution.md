definition: Pixel resolution refers to the amount of detail an image holds, typically
  expressed as the number of pixels in width by the number of pixels in height (e.g.,
  1920x1080). Higher pixel resolution means more image detail and clarity, impacting
  the overall quality of the visual display or photograph.
