title: In Situ Resource Utilisation
ref: in-situ-resource-utilisation
description: In-situ Resource Utilisation (ISRU) refers to the practice of harnessing
  and utilizing resources available in the environment where an operation is taking
  place, rather than transporting them from Earth or another location. This concept
  is particularly relevant in space exploration, where using local materials for fuel,
  water, and building materials can significantly reduce the costs and logistics of
  missions.
