definition: Influencer marketing is a form of marketing that focuses on using key
  opinion leaders, or influencers, to drive a brand's message to a larger market.
  Instead of marketing directly to a large group of consumers, the brand inspires,
  hires, or pays influencers to get out the word for them.
