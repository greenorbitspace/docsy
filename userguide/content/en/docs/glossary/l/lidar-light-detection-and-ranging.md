definition: LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a remote sensing technology that
  uses laser light to measure distances to the Earth's surface. It collects high-resolution
  data by emitting rapid pulses of light and measuring the time it takes for each
  pulse to bounce back, allowing for precise mapping of terrain and vegetation.
