title: Lidar (Light Detection And Ranging)
ref: lidar-light-detection-and-ranging
description: LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a remote sensing technology that
  uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure variable distances to the Earth.
  It generates precise, three-dimensional information about the shape of the Earth
  and its surface characteristics, making it useful for a variety of applications,
  including mapping, forestry, environmental monitoring, and autonomous vehicles.
