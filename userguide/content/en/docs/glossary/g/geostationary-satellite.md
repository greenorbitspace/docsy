  same rotational speed as the Earth, allowing it to remain in a fixed position relative
  to a specific point on the Earth's surface. This type of satellite is typically
  positioned at an altitude of approximately 35,786 kilometers (22,236 miles) above
  the equator and is commonly used for telecommunications, weather monitoring, and
