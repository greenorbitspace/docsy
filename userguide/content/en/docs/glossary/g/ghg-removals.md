definition: GHG removals refer to the processes and technologies that capture and
  remove greenhouse gases (GHGs) from the atmosphere. This can include natural processes
  like afforestation and reforestation, as well as technological solutions such as
  carbon capture and storage (CCS). GHG removals are essential in mitigating climate
  change and achieving net-zero emissions goals.
