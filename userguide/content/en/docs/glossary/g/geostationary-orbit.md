title: Geostationary Orbit
ref: geostationary-orbit
description: A geostationary orbit is a circular orbit around the Earth where a satellite's
  orbital period matches the Earth's rotation period. This allows the satellite to
  remain in the same position relative to the Earth's surface, making it appear stationary
  to observers on the ground. Geostationary orbits are typically located at an altitude
  of about 35,786 kilometers (22,236 miles) above the equator.
