definition: A geostationary orbit is a circular orbit around the Earth where a satellite
  has an orbital period that matches the Earth's rotation period. This allows the
  satellite to remain fixed over a specific point on the Earth's surface, making it
  ideal for telecommunications and weather monitoring.
