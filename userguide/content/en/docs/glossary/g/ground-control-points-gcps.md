ref: ground-control-points-gcps
description: Ground Control Points (GCPs) are specific points on the ground with known
  geographic coordinates that are used in geospatial applications to improve the accuracy
  of aerial imagery and mapping. They serve as reference points that help in the correction
  of distortions in images and ensure that the spatial data aligns correctly with
  real-world locations.
