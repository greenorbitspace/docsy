definition: Double opt-in is a confirmation process used in email marketing where
  a subscriber must confirm their subscription by clicking a link in a confirmation
  email sent to them after they initially sign up. This ensures that the subscriber
  genuinely wants to receive communications and helps to maintain a clean and engaged
  email list.
