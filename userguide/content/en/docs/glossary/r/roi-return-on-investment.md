definition: Return on Investment (ROI) is a financial metric used to evaluate the
  profitability of an investment relative to its cost. It is calculated by dividing
  the net profit from the investment by the initial cost, typically expressed as a
  percentage. A higher ROI indicates a more favorable investment.
