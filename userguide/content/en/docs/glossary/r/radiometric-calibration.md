definition: Radiometric calibration is the process of ensuring that the measurements
  obtained from a sensor or imaging system accurately reflect the true radiance of
  the observed scene. This calibration is crucial for quantifying the data collected
  by remote sensing instruments, enabling consistent and reliable analysis of the
  information gathered.
