title: Radiometric Calibration
ref: radiometric-calibration
description: Radiometric calibration is the process of adjusting and correcting the
  output of a sensor to ensure that the measurements it provides accurately reflect
  the true intensity of the radiation being measured. This process is essential for
  ensuring the reliability and accuracy of data collected in remote sensing and imaging
  applications.
