title: Residual Emissions
ref: residual-emissions
description: Residual emissions refer to the greenhouse gases that remain in the atmosphere
  after all feasible mitigation efforts have been implemented. These emissions are
  often the result of processes that are difficult to eliminate entirely and can include
  emissions from industrial activities, agriculture, and transportation. Understanding
  residual emissions is crucial for developing strategies to achieve net-zero emissions
  and for assessing the overall impact of climate change initiatives.
