title: Radar Remote Sensing
ref: radar-remote-sensing
description: Radar remote sensing is a technique that uses radar signals to detect
  and analyze objects or surfaces from a distance. It involves the transmission of
  microwave signals that bounce off the target and return to the sensor, allowing
  for the collection of data related to the distance, speed, and characteristics of
  the object being observed.
