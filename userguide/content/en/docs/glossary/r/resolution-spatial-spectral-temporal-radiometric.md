title: Resolution (Spatial, Spectral, Temporal, Radiometric)
ref: resolution-spatial-spectral-temporal-radiometric
description: 'Resolution refers to the ability of an imaging system to distinguish
  between two or more separate objects or features. It can be categorized into four
  types:


  - Spatial Resolution: The level of detail in an image, defined by the smallest discernible
  feature.

  - Spectral Resolution: The ability to resolve features in the electromagnetic spectrum,
  determining how finely the spectrum is divided.

  - Temporal Resolution: The frequency at which data is collected over time, affecting
  how dynamic changes are captured.

  - Radiometric Resolution: The sensitivity of a sensor to detect variations in energy
  levels, indicating how many different values of intensity can be captured.'
