title: Synthetic Aperture Radar (Sar)
ref: synthetic-aperture-radar-sar
description: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a form of radar that is used to create
  two-dimensional images or three-dimensional reconstructions of objects, such as
  landscapes. SAR technology uses the motion of the radar antenna over a target region
  to provide finer spatial resolution than conventional beam-scanning radars.
