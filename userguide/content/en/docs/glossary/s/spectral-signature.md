definition: A spectral signature is a unique pattern of light absorption and reflection
  that is characteristic of a particular material or substance. It is used in remote
  sensing and spectroscopy to identify and analyze the composition of objects, such
  as planets, minerals, and vegetation, based on the specific wavelengths of light
  they emit or reflect.
