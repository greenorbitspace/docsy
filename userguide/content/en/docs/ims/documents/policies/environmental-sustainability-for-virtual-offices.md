### From Within to the World Beyond

<!-- Unsupported block type: image -->

## Zoho's Ecosystem

To achieve Net Zero, emissions released by human activities should be counterbalanced by removing carbon from the atmosphere. Increasingly, enterprises worldwide have also come out strong in their commitments to net zero. The real question, however, lies in their plan of execution.

Zoho has taken a forward thinking approach to Environment, Social and Governance practises. By leveraging cutting edge technology and the Internet of Things, the Net Zero dream is now becoming a reality.

## Efficient Energy

Energy efficiency is a key component to support net zero energy goals at lower costs.

- 

- 

- 

## Carbon Reduction

Globally, emissions need to be cut down by 45% by 2030, in order to achieve net zero by 2050. 60% of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas reserves) need to be replaced by efficient energy sources to achieve net zero. Zoho joins hands with the rest of the globe with:

- 

## Water Conservation

According to the latest climate change projections, the intensity and frequency of heatwaves and droughts will only increase in the future. And by 2030, water supply will satisfy only 60% of global demand on average. To ensure resilience of operations, it is essential that businesses address this as priority. Zoho currently deploys:

- Sensors to detect leakage of faucets

- Rain sensing sprinkler systems

- Smart Water management to monitor and track real time usage

Additionally, the ongoing construction of ponds and lakes on site will help preserve water and recharge the groundwater table.

## Zero Waste

The economy’s very existence centres around consumption. Consumption, in turn, requires extraction of materials, heat, power, electricity and towards the end, waste management. Waste management should not be at the end of the pipeline, but rather the focal point itself. Implementing zero waste strategies can reduce overall GHG emissions from waste by an average of 84%.

## Sustainable Procurement

With conscious purchasing decisions, Zoho ensures e-waste is recycled where possible. With reduced usage of paper and encouraging digital transformation at its core:

## Zoho's ways of winning for the world

### CSR @ Zoho

Zoho bagged the SEZ Excellence award for CSR and Renewable energy in 2019-20. Zohoites are always up for community projects. Be it cleaning local parks, planting saplings or painting walls!

### Environmental Monitoring

With Zoho's IOT, monitoring source emissions, air, noise and water has helped us keep pace with our goal.

### Awareness Initiatives

Educational resources such as blogs, videos and infographics to educate the need for ESG.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Net Zero?

A target of completely negating the amount of greenhouse gases produced by human activity, to be achieved by reducing emissions and implementing methods of absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The Net zero coalition by UN states aims to reduce emissions by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. In order to do so, we need to maintain global warming to no more than 1.5°C.

### What is Carbon negative?

The reduction of an entity's carbon footprint to less than neutral, so that the entity has a net effect of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere rather than adding it.

### What is ESG?

Environmental (E) assesses how a company performs as a steward of nature. It analyses how its activities impact the environment and manage environmental risks.

Social criteria (S) examines the strengths and weaknesses of how a company manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities where it operates.

Governance (G) deals with a company’s leadership, executive pay, audits, internal controls, and shareholder rights. Investors want to know if they can trust the company and what kind of decisions are taken behind closed doors.

### Why is ESG essential for companies?

According to a recent study, It has been demonstrated that companies performing on ESG practices have higher financial growth and optimisation, lower volatility, higher employee productivity, reduced regulatory and legal interventions (fines and sanctions), top-line growth, and cost reductions. For businesses to stay resilient, it is imperative to integrate ESG into their core framework.
