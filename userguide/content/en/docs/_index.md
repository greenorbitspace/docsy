Welcome to the Green Orbit Digital documentation hub! This guide helps you get started
with our tools, values, and frameworks for delivering ethical, data-driven marketing
within the space and climate tech sectors.

Whether you're a collaborator, contributor, or client, this hub is your central resource
for aligning with our mission and working transparently across all touchpoints.

## What is Green Orbit Digital?

Green Orbit Digital is a Leicester-based marketing agency focused on sustainable growth
for space, science, and technology ventures. We specialise in aligning marketing
performance with planetary responsibility, using strategies that are:

- Data-driven and agile
- Carbon-aware and transparent
- Aligned with the UN SDGs and ethical design principles

[Learn more about Green Orbit Digital](https://greenorbit.space).

In addition to our digital services, we offer reusable frameworks and operational models
that help teams integrate sustainability into every level of communication and strategy.
This site serves as a living knowledge base for those systems, processes, and values.

Our documentation includes:

- Project templates and contributor guidelines
- Carbon impact estimation tools
- Ethics checklists and reporting frameworks
- Campaign planning and measurement guides

This documentation is actively maintained and versioned alongside our services and platform
tooling.

## What this site does *not* cover

This documentation does **not** provide:

- **Marketing tutorials or general education content**: For learning SEO, analytics, or
  copywriting basics, we recommend domain-specific training platforms. Our focus is on
  applying those skills ethically in climate and space contexts.
- **Third-party platform manuals**: While we reference tools like HubSpot, Notion, or
  Stripe, we link out to their official documentation rather than duplicating it.
- **Sales materials or promotional copy**: This hub is operational, not commercial.

We also don’t duplicate public knowledge from external sustainability authorities. Where
possible, we cite open standards and link to governing bodies or repositories (e.g. the SDG
Compass or Ecograder).

## Is this documentation for you?

This site is especially useful if you are:

- Working on a collaborative campaign with Green Orbit Digital
- Contributing to internal frameworks or strategy tools
- Auditing processes for transparency, carbon reporting, or ethics alignment
- Reviewing or updating content for client delivery
- Exploring sustainable marketing operations in a regulated or high-impact sector
