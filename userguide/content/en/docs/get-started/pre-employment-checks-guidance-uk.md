Green Orbit Digital Pre-employment Checks Guidance (UK)

1. Introduction

Green Orbit Digital is committed to ensuring that the hiring process is thorough, fair, and legally compliant. Pre-employment checks are an essential part of the recruitment process, providing a safeguard against fraud, ensuring that candidates are suitable for the role, and protecting the company’s reputation. This guidance outlines the key pre-employment checks required in the UK and the steps to follow to ensure compliance with legal requirements.

1. Purpose of Pre-employment Checks

Pre-employment checks help:

Verify the accuracy of the information provided by candidates.

Ensure candidates have the necessary qualifications and experience for the role.

Maintain a safe, compliant, and inclusive work environment.

Protect Green Orbit Digital from potential liabilities.

1. Pre-employment Checks Overview

The specific checks to be carried out will vary depending on the role, but the following checks are commonly required in the UK:

1. Right to Work in the UK
All candidates must be legally entitled to work in the UK. Employers are legally obligated to verify a candidate’s right to work before they start employment.

Documents to verify: Valid passport, biometric residence permit, national identity card, or immigration status document.

Check process: The candidate must provide the relevant documents, and these must be inspected in person by a responsible representative (e.g., HR or recruitment team). Copies of the documents should be kept securely on file.

Legal obligation: Employers must ensure they have complied with the right to work requirements, or they may face penalties, including fines or criminal prosecution.

1. Identity Verification
Confirming the identity of a candidate ensures that they are who they claim to be.

Documents to verify: Photo ID such as a passport, driving licence, or national identity card.

Process: Verification of name, date of birth, and current address may also be undertaken using utility bills or bank statements (if required by the role).

1. Criminal Record Checks (DBS Checks)
For roles that involve working with vulnerable individuals or specific responsibilities (e.g., handling financial data), criminal background checks may be required.

Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check: This check is mandatory for roles that involve working with children or vulnerable adults. Employers can apply for an enhanced DBS check, which will disclose any relevant criminal records and whether the candidate is barred from working with certain groups.

Standard DBS check: For roles that do not involve working with vulnerable individuals but still require criminal record checks, a standard DBS check may be requested.

Process: Green Orbit Digital will only request a DBS check for roles where it is legally required or otherwise deemed necessary.

1. Employment History Verification
To ensure that candidates have the relevant work experience and qualifications, Green Orbit Digital will verify employment history.

Checks to carry out: Contacting previous employers to verify roles, dates of employment, and performance (subject to candidate consent). This check is especially important for senior or high-risk positions.

Verification of employment gaps: If a candidate has a significant gap in employment, Green Orbit Digital may request further information to understand the reasons behind the gap (e.g., personal reasons, education, travel, etc.).

1. Qualification and Certification Verification
Verifying the educational background and professional qualifications of candidates is vital to ensuring they meet the job’s requirements.

Checks to carry out: Contacting educational institutions or reviewing official documentation such as degree certificates, professional certifications, and licensing details.

Process: Ensure that the qualification is relevant and genuine for the specific role.

1. References
Green Orbit Digital will typically request at least two references from previous employers or professional contacts who can speak to the candidate’s qualifications, work ethic, and conduct.

Reference check process: Reference requests should include confirmation of job titles, dates of employment, and performance/attendance. For candidates who have not been employed before, references may be sought from educational institutions or personal references.

Content: Green Orbit Digital will seek references that assess the candidate’s suitability for the role, reliability, and behaviour.

1. Financial Checks
For roles that involve managing finances, access to financial data, or making financial decisions, financial checks may be necessary.

Credit history checks: If relevant to the role, a credit check may be requested, particularly for senior financial roles. This helps ensure the candidate’s suitability for positions of financial responsibility.

Process: Candidates must be informed that a credit check will be conducted, and their consent must be obtained before proceeding.

1. Health and Medical Checks
For specific roles, particularly those with health and safety implications (e.g., physically demanding roles), a health or fitness assessment may be required.

Health declaration: Candidates may be required to complete a medical questionnaire or attend a medical examination as part of the recruitment process. This helps determine whether any reasonable adjustments are required.

Occupational health assessments: In some cases, an occupational health professional may assess whether the candidate can perform the physical requirements of the job.

1. Consent and Data Protection

Consent: Candidates must be informed about the checks being conducted and provide their consent, either verbally or in writing, before the checks are carried out.

Data Protection: All pre-employment checks must be carried out in line with the Data Protection Act 2018 (UK) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This means ensuring that personal data is processed lawfully, transparently, and securely. Personal information gathered through pre-employment checks should only be used for recruitment purposes.

Confidentiality: The information gathered during pre-employment checks should be kept confidential and stored securely in accordance with Green Orbit Digital’s data retention policies.

1. Timing of Pre-employment Checks

Pre-employment checks should be completed as soon as possible after a conditional offer has been made, but before the candidate’s employment begins. However, the process must not cause unnecessary delays, and candidates should be kept informed throughout.

1. Handling Negative Results

If any pre-employment check yields negative results (e.g., a criminal conviction, false employment history, or failure to provide qualifications):

The hiring manager or HR should discuss the findings with the candidate to understand the context and determine the next steps.

A decision should be made on whether to proceed with the hiring process, considering the nature of the discrepancy and the role in question.

In cases of serious concerns (e.g., criminal convictions related to the role), the offer may be withdrawn.

1. Monitoring and Compliance

Green Orbit Digital will monitor and review the pre-employment checks process regularly to ensure compliance with legal requirements and company policy. Managers and HR personnel involved in recruitment must be adequately trained on these procedures.

1. Conclusion

Pre-employment checks are essential to maintaining a safe, effective, and legally compliant recruitment process. Green Orbit Digital ensures that all checks are carried out fairly and consistently while respecting candidates’ rights. By following this guidance, the company aims to uphold high standards in recruitment and safeguard its operations.
