Read through our Markdown Style Guide!

The guide covers usage of Markdown. If you’re looking for something and can’t find it, it may be on the shortcodes page.

## Markdown Style Guide for the Handbook

This style guide is for  The GitLab Handbook . For styles in the GitLab UI, see the GitLab Flavored Markdown documentation. For the style guide, for the www-gitlab-com pages, see Markdown Guide.

This website was generated by Hugo, a blog-aware Static Site Generator (SSG) widely used by web developers. Markup language is part of the structure of any SSG. It is a system to write documents making them somehow syntactically distinguishable from text. Lightweight markup languages have a simplified and unobtrusive syntax, designed to be easily written within any text editor. That’s what we use to write our content. The majority of SSGs use markdown engines for this purpose. Read through our blog post on Modern Static Site Generators to understand how they work.

For The GitLab Handbook we use Goldmark, which is an advanced Markdown engine written in Go and comes bundled as part of Hugo. It implements the CommonMark markdown standard, it’s is extensible and very fast at transforming Markdown to HTML. As such, we encourage use of Markdown as much as possible, though we allow HTML inline (MD033).

If you never have written a single line in markdown markup, don’t worry, it’s easy to learn and even easier to use. You’ll probably be surprised how handy it is once you get used to it. And you’ll miss it whenever the tech you’re using doesn’t support markdown.

In most of GitLab text areas you’ll find markdown support. We have a number of markdown engines in GitLab so the markup will not behave equally “GitLabwide”. For GitLab.com, GitLab CE and GitLab EE text areas, the markdown engine is currently CommonMarker. Here you can find the markdown style guide for them. In the for the handbook projects, you’ll see Kramdown used.

This guide has been made to make it easier for everyone to use Hugo and Goldmark features and save a lot of time writing content for The GitLab Handbook .

There are different possible syntaxes for most of the markups described below, but this guide is to be considered the standard for The GitLab Handbook .

For information on how markdown is verified in the pipeline, refer to the development docs. Relevant customized markdownlint rules are noted in the format MD###.

## Headings

Content headings should be descriptive enough to suggest their corresponding content when they or corresponding fragment identifiers are seen out of context. Fragment identifiers are automatically generated from most headings. Keep that in mind when choosing your headings.

Markdown

```plain text
## Heading h2
### Heading h3
#### Heading h4

```

Output

## Heading h2

### Heading h3

### Heading h4

Notes on heading structure:

- We don’t use h1 headings, as they already are displayed on every page as its title, and we should not apply more than one h1 per page (MD002, MD041).

- Always start with h2 (##), and respect the order h2 → h3 → h4. Never skip the hierarchy level, such as h2 → h4. 

- To prevent confusion, headings at the same level should not be duplicated (MD024).

Notes on individual headings:

- We enforce using the atx style of heading, where the heading starts with one or more hashes (MD003).

- Always leave a blank space between the hash # and the text next to it, otherwise it won’t render properly.

- Have an empty line before and after, to keep the text clear and the markdown consistent.

- Headings should be no longer than 100 characters (MD013). To make a larger amount of text stand out, use emphasis or shortcodes, such as alerts.

- Headings should not end in punctuation (MD026).

- Headings should not have links in them. The site automatically makes headings anchor links, but links in headings can override the behavior.

- Headings should use sentence case. (Not enforced.)

- While emphasis instead of header is allowed (MD036), it is not recommended.

## Paragraphs, breaks, and horizontal lines

Regular paragraphs are obtained by just writing text lines. If you hit enter between two lines, both lines will be joined into a single paragraph, which is called wrapping text. But, if you leave a blank line between them, they will split into two paragraphs.

In some Git tools, diffs in future MRs may be easier to understand with additional line breaks, however GitLab’s web interface as well as many desktop Git tools feature substring change highlighting within lines and side-by-side or similar version comparison so there is no need for artificial line breaks.

### Wrapping Text

Splitting long lines (preferably up to 100 characters) can make it easier to provide feedback on small chunks of text. Do not leave blank spaces after the last word of the line broken within a paragraph, unless you want it to be intentionally broken with a <br>.

### Regular paragraphs and automatic join

Markdown

```plain text
This text is a paragraph.
This won't be another paragraph, it will join the line above it.
This will be another paragraph, as it has a blank line above it.

```

Output

This text is a paragraph. This won't be another paragraph, it will join the line above it.

This will be another paragraph, as it has a blank line above it.

### Additional breaks

In case you need an additional break (or some extra space between lines), you can simply use the HTML break tag <br>, leaving blank lines above and below it:

Markdown

```plain text
Text A
<!-- blank line -->
<br>
<!-- blank line -->
Text B

```

Output

Text A

Text B

### Horizontal lines

A sequence of three or more dashes will produce a horizontal line, but let’s use always 3 as standard (MD035). Leave blank lines after and before it:

Markdown

```plain text
Text
<!-- blank line -->
---
<!-- blank line -->
Text

```

Output

Text

Text

## Emphasis: bold and italic

To display bold or italic text, wrap it in underscores for italic, or 2 asterisks for bold. For both italic and bold, wrap it in 3 stars:

Markdown

```plain text
This is **bold** and this is _italic_.
This is _**bold and italic**_.

```

Output

This is bold and this is italic.

This is bold and italic.

While single asterisks can be used for italic, and 2 underscores can be used for bold, the described usage above is the preferred formatting. The linter does not enforce these guidelines though, and only checks for consistency on the page. (MD049, MD050)

Markdown doesn’t natively support underlined text. If necessary you can hardcode it with the HTML tag ins (<ins>underlined text</ins>), however, it is inadvisable to do so.

## Links

There are a few different ways to display links with markdown markup, but to keep some standards, let’s try to use the following options only.

### Important notes

- Don’t take it as a restrictive rule, but avoid using meaningless text for links as “this article” or “read here.” The link text should be meaningful even if taken out of context; this makes the links more useful and accessible for people using screen readers.

### Inline Links

We’d rather use inline links, such as [Text to display](link), as they are easier to maintain. To make an inline link open in a new tab, you can add {:target="_blank"} to the end. Ex: [Text to display](link){:target="_blank"}

### Relative links

Use relative links when referring to links found on the same handbook site: handbook.gitlab.com for the public handbook, and internal.gitlab.com for the internal handbook.

When linking to a heading on the same page, use [link text](#the-heading).

When linking to other pages within the same handbook (or repository), use relative links. You can either link to the markdown file (which is the easiest when using the editor) or the final version of the link. Some examples:

<!-- Unsupported block type: table -->

Alternatively, you can link to the final version of the page link without the domain if it’s in the same handbook. For example, a link to our blog handbook page should look like this /handbook/marketing/blog/ and not this https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/blog/.

Only use the absolute (not relative) link, including the domain https://example.com, if the page is not in the same repository. For example, if you are editing the public handbook and need to link to an internal handbook page.

Hugo can reference reference pages without having to use the full relative path. However, for consistency and easy of use, we use plain Markdown links, and avoid using the Hugo ref or relref shortcodes.

For links to GitLab.com or anywhere else, you must use the entire link, including the https:.

While reference (identifier) links can be used, they are discouraged.

### mailto links

If you’re adding an email address to a page be sure to format your link with mailto to avoid creating broken links. For example, [example@gitlab.com](mailto:example@gitlab.com)

## Lists

Both ordered and unordered lists are very straightforward to produce. There are a few ways to produce the same results, but let’s stick with the following, again, to maintain some standards.

1. Always start list items with a capital letter.

1. Always leave a blank line before and after a list. Though this is currently not enforced (MD022).

1. Begin a line with spaces (not tabs) to denote a nested sub-item. Items nested in lists should always align with the first character of the list item. 

Tip: don’t leave blank lines between the items, unless you have a reason to do so.

### Important

Always leave a blank line between Headings and the subsequent list! If you don’t, the list will not render.

The Writing Style Guide recommends using ordered lists when you have multiple items, because Numbered lists are easier to reference during a discussion over bulleted lists.

See the Documentation Style Guide for other helpful tips.

### Ordered lists

Ordered lists are pretty easy to create. Couldn’t be more intuitive:

Markdown

```plain text
Paragraph:
1. Item one
   1. Sub item one
   2. Sub item two
   3. Sub item three
2. Item two

```

Output

Paragraph:

1. Item one 

1. Item two

To be practical and avoid errors on the numbers, use “1” for all the items. The markdown engine will output them in the correct order.

Markdown

```plain text
Paragraph:
1. Item one
   1. Sub item one
   1. Sub item two
1. Item two
1. Item three

```

Output

Paragraph:

1. Item one 

1. Item two

1. Item three

### Unordered lists

Unordered lists are very easy to create too:

Markdown

```plain text
Paragraph:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
  - Sub item 1
  - Sub item 2
- Item 4

```

Output

Paragraph:

- Item 1

- Item 2

- Item 3 

- Item 4

### Split lists

Let’s say, for some reason, you want to split a list in different parts. To do that, use the markup ^ to indicate the end of a list and the beginning of the next:

Markdown

```plain text
- list one - item 1
- list one - item 2
  - sub item 1
  - sub item 2
- list one - item 3
^
- list two - item A
- list two - item B
^
- list three - item _i_
- list three - item _ii_

```

Output

- list one - item 1

- list one - item 2 

- list one - item 3

- list two - item A

- list two - item B

- list three - item i

- list three - item ii

## Images

To insert images to your markdown file, use the markup ![ALT](/images/path/image.ext). The path can either be relative to the website, or a full URL for an external image. The supported formats are .png, .jpg, .gif. You might be able to use some .svg files too, depending on its structure.

Images should be added to the static/images folder in the handbook repository, using subdirectories as necessary for organization. For example, static/images/company/company_hierarchy.png to be used on the /handbook/company/hierarchy.md page, and using the path /images/company/company_hierarchy.png. Note that this is enforced for images being added.

As images added in this way will not render in the markdown editor preview, use review apps instead.

All images should be 100KB or less, ideally, 25-50KB. Consider compressing images and using the PNG format. The handbook linter checks for a maximum of 500KB.

```plain text
![Semantic description of image](/images/path/to/folder/image.png "Image Title")

```

If you want to add a caption to your image, it’s easily achieved with:

```plain text
![Semantic description of image](/images/path/to/folder/image.png)*My caption*

```

For clickable images, simply wrap the image markup into a link markup:

```plain text
[![Semantic description of image](/images/path/to/folder/image.png "Hello World")*My caption*][handbook.gitlab.com]

```

Output

My caption

<!-- Unsupported block type: image -->

### Important notes

- Only screenshots and public domain images are permitted.

- The text inside the square brackets is an image attribute called ALT, which stands for alternative text. Including descriptive alt text helps maintain accessibility for every visitor and should always be included with an image. When you add alt text, be sure to describe the content and function of an image. In addition to the accessibility benefits, ALT is useful for SEO, and it is displayed when, for some reason, that image is not loaded by the browser.

- For the same reasons, the image must contain a name related to it. Example: instead of image-01.jpg, name it black-dog.jpg, if it’s a photo of a black dog.

- It’s also recommended to add an image title for a longer description when necessary. The formatting is shown in the example above with the “Hello World” text.

## Diagrams

There are two ways to insert diagrams with Markdown:

1. Mermaid

1. PlantUML

### Mermaid

See the examples in the GitLabm docs on how to use Mermaid. We have a number of Handbook-specific example in the Tools and Tips Section.

### PlantUML

You can use PlantUML in Markdown blocks. For example:

Markdown

```plain text
```plantuml
!define ICONURL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tupadr3/plantuml-icon-font-sprites/v2.1.0
skinparam defaultTextAlignment center
!include ICONURL/common.puml
!include ICONURL/font-awesome-5/gitlab.puml
!include ICONURL/font-awesome-5/java.puml
!include ICONURL/font-awesome-5/rocket.puml
!include ICONURL/font-awesome/newspaper_o.puml
FA_NEWSPAPER_O(news,good news!,node) #White {
FA5_GITLAB(gitlab,GitLab.com,node) #White
FA5_JAVA(java,PlantUML,node) #White
FA5_ROCKET(rocket,Integrated,node) #White
}
gitlab ..> java
java ..> rocket
```

```

Output

<!-- Unsupported block type: image -->

## Videos

There are multiple ways of displaying videos:

1. Using a shortcode (preferred method).

1. Within <iframe> tags.

1. Within HTML5 <video> tags.

Note that videos, along with all other files, have a maximum limit of 15MB.

### Display videos from website

### Prefer shortcode

Please check for a shortcode for the hosting site, such as YouTube and Vimeo, before using this method.

This method works for any embed video within an <iframe> tag.

1. Copy the code below and paste it into your markdown file. Leave a blank line above and below it. Do NOT edit the code block (such as, remove spaces - the video iframe may not render properly)

1. Go the video URL you want to display

1. Click on “Share”, then “Embed”

1. Copy the <iframe> source (src) URL only, and paste it replacing the src below:

HTML

```plain text
<!-- blank line -->
<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6m34D8cFdpMZndKTlBRU0tmczg/preview" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
</figure>
<!-- blank line -->

```

Output

### Display local videos (HTML5)

We recommend one of the common formats, such as mp4 and mkv.

Videos should be added to the static/videos folder in the handbook repository, using subdirectories as necessary for organization. For example, static/videos/company/company_mission.mp4 to be used on the /handbook/company/_index.md page, and using the path /videos/company/company_mission.mp4. Note that this is enforced for images being added.

This method works for any video uploaded to somewhere retrievable from the internet from a URL, or from a relative path like path/to/video.mp4.

1. Read through the w3schools HTML5 video guide, or the MDN <video> guide

1. Record or export the video in these three formats to achieve cross-browser and cross-device compatibility: .mp4 or .ogg.

1. Get the URL for your video

1. Choose an image to use as a poster

1. Copy the code below and paste it to your file

1. Replace the src URLs for your video URLs

HTML

```plain text
<!-- blank line -->
<figure class="video_container">
  <video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true" poster="path/to/poster_image.png">
    <source src="path/to/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="path/to/video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
  </video>
</figure>
<!-- blank line -->

```

Output

<!-- Unsupported block type: video -->

### Note

In case you don’t have all formats recommended by w3schools, you can use just one of them, but your video most likely won’t be supported in all devices and browsers. The video above (.mp4 only) worked on Mozilla Firefox for macOS, Android, and Windows, and on Chrome for Android, and for Windows. But it may not work on other devices/browser, such as Chrome for macOS and iOS, or Safari. In fact, the best option is using YouTube or Vimeo embed videos in <iframe> tags.

### Display multiple videos

To display multiple videos on the same page, just repeat the figure code block where you want them to show up, replacing the video ID with the respective ID corresponding to your videos.

To display multiple videos in a sequence, just copy the figure code block and paste it as many times as necessary. Always leave a blank line between the blocks. Do NOT remove the spaces, otherwise your videos may not render properly.

```plain text
<!-- blank line -->
<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6m34D8cFdpMZndKTlBRU0tmczg/preview" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
</figure>
<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6m34D8cFdpMZndKTlBRU0tmczg/preview" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
</figure>
<figure class="video_container">
  <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6m34D8cFdpMZndKTlBRU0tmczg/preview" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
</figure>
<!-- blank line -->

```

## Tables

Tables for markdown are challenging. So, we have two possible approaches: use markdown whenever possible, but if you need pretty advanced table layouts, you are free to add them in HTML markup instead.

> 

### Note

For very simple 2 column tables it is better to use lists with strong text in preference to the complexity of using markdown tables.

The following table has a header (first line), then markup to define the desired alignment (dashes and colons), then the table body.

However you prepare your table, its design will depend upon the CSS styles defined for them.

```plain text
| Default aligned | Left aligned | Center aligned  | Right aligned  |
|-----------------|:-------------|:---------------:|---------------:|
| First body part | Second cell  | Third cell      | fourth cell    |
| Second line     | foo          | **strong**      | baz            |
| Third line      | quux         | baz             | bar            |

```

<!-- Unsupported block type: table -->

The bars, spaces, and dashes were used symmetrically in the previous example to help future page developers if they need to edit the table’s contents. The symmetry isn’t required.

Some development tools can help you create your own complex table if you need to merge lines or columns, or if you require a more complex layout. This [table generator] may be able to help you do this.

To add a numbered list in a table cell, add a blank line between the heading and the table to render the table correctly. Otherwise, the text and formatting won’t appear.

To create more complex tables, you need to use HTML.

## Collapse

A collapsed content section is used to hide information until a user chooses to reveal it with a click or tap on the summary text. The hidden content is revealed inline. For example, this code:

Markdown

```plain text
<!-- Removed shortcode: details summary="This is the summary text, click me to expand" -->
This is the detailed text.
We can still use markdown and <strong>HTML</strong> in this block.


```

Output

<!-- Unsupported block type: toggle -->

The GitLab handbook also supports nested details sections.

Markdown

```plain text
<!-- Removed shortcode: details summary="First level collapsible item" -->
**Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...**
<!-- Removed shortcode: details summary="Second level collapsible item" -->
_Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus..._



```

Output

<!-- Unsupported block type: toggle -->

## Code blocks

There are a few options for displaying code blocks with Markdown. Most of them use backticks `.

### In-line

There is the in-line code block. Used this to reference very short bits of code, filenames and folder paths, and programming symbols and objects in a bit of text. The whole line including the code block should read fluidly.

Markdown

```plain text
This is an  `in-line` code block.

```

Output

This is an in-line code block.

### Fenced with syntax highlighting

Note: While indented code formatting is common, we enforce “fenced” for code blocks (MD046).

This is the most common code block you will encounter and use. You can use this to share whole sections of code within a markdown document. The additional syntax highlighting makes the code easier to read and understand. The highlight function supports a large number of languages including Ruby, Python, Rust, Swift, etc.

If a language is not supported, or for text, use text or plain as the language. Markdownlint currently enforces specifying a language.

Markdown

```plain text
```ruby
def hello
   puts "Hello world!"
end
```

```

Output

```plain text
def hello
   puts "Hello world!"
end

```

### In lists

Indent the text of each item in 2 white spaces (for unordered lists) or 3 white spaces (for ordered lists). Leave blank lines between the code block and the list items, and indent the code block in 5 white spaces:

Markdown

```plain text
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
   ```ruby
   def hello
      puts "Hello world!"
   end
   ```
1. Item 3

```

Output

1. Item 1

1. Item 2 ```ruby def hello puts "Hello world!" end ```

1. Item 3

## Blockquotes

Blockquotes are good resources to mentioning someone else’s quotes. Also, can be used to emphasize a sentence or a small paragraph.

Markdown

```plain text
> This is a blockquote.
> On multiple lines.
That may be lazy.
>
> This is the second paragraph.
---
> This is a paragraph.
>
> > A nested blockquote.
>
> ### Headers work
>
> - lists too
>
> and all other block-level **elements**.
>
> Even code blocks:
>
> ```ruby
> def hello
>   puts "Hello world!"
> end
> ```

```

Output

> 

> 

## Comments

There are two types of comment which can be used. The first allows you to leave comments in a markdown file which can only be viewed in the repository and are not rendered to HTML or included in a pages source. The second type is a standard HTML comment which will be included in the pages source.

### Markdown comments

See comments shortcode.

### HTML Markup comments

It is also possible to use HTML comments. These differ in that they are also included in the rendered pages source.

Markdown

```plain text
This is a paragraph <!-- This is accepted as a comment too --> ... paragraph continues here.

```

Output

This is a paragraph  … paragraph continues here.

Output HTML

```plain text
<p>This is a paragraph <!-- This is accepted as a comment too -->…
paragraph continues here.</p>

```

## Anchors

Typically you shouldn’t need anchors as well structured documents with headings should prove a good route to linking to text you may want to reference on another page. All headings act as anchors on a page. However there maybe times when you need it, such as if you have an icon in the header.

There are multiple ways to add an anchor.

### Markdown Anchors

This is the preferred method of handling anchors in the handbook.

The extended markdown syntax includes anchors, or heading IDs.

Markdown

```plain text
## Anchors are invisible elements {#hello-world}

```

Output

## Anchors are invisible elements

Output HTML

```plain text
<h2 id="hello-world">Anchors are invisible elements</h2>

```

### Shortcode Anchors

This small shortcode will drop an anchor in a page which you can reference from the same page or another page. The text in quote marks is the name of anchor you’ll use when linking to it.

Markdown

```plain text
<!-- inline link or anchor removed --> Anchors are invisible elements

```

Output

Anchors are invisible elements

Output HTML

```plain text
<a name="hello-world"></a> Anchors are invisible elements

```

### HTML Anchors

One of the more powerful features of using Markdown is the ability to mix HTML and Markdown in the same document. With this in mind it is also possible to use normal HTML to create an anchor in a page. This is the method you need to use when adding anchors to markdown documents not in the GitLab Handbook.

Markdown

```plain text
<a name="goodbye-world"></a> Anchors are invisible elements

```

Output

Anchors are invisible elements

## Emoji and Font Awesome

Hugo and Docsy provide support for using both Emojis and Font Awesome to provide icons and simple graphics to spice up your content.

### Emojis

To insert emojis in to content you can use the same syntax as you find on GitLab and Slack. Use a : followed by the name of the emoji followed by another :. Its also possible to look up emojis on the ‘Emoji Cheat Sheet’.

Note: When copying from the cheatsheet it includes the colons for you.

Markdown

I :‌orange_heart: GitLab

Output

I :orange_heart: GitLab

### Font Awesome

Font Awesome is loaded indirectly through the Docsy theme. The icon library provides thousands of free to use and open source glyphs and icons which can be embedded into handbook content. The easiest way to use Font Awesome is to copy the HTML for the glyph directly from the Font Awesome Icon gallery and paste it directly in to your content.

It is recommended to use the review app to preview the changes. At times, the loaded version of Font Awesome is not the latest.

Markdown

```plain text
<i class="fa-regular fa-heart fa-2xl"></i>

```

Output

Note: The minimum requirement is one of the base classes (such as fas or fa-regular) and the icon class (such as fa-heart).

### Splash of color

It is possible to add a splash of color to Font Awesome icons by adding -text-<color> (for example -text-success) to the end of the class definition. Where it says color you can replace this with any of the available shortcode colors.

Markdown

```plain text
<i class="fa-brands fa-gitlab fa-2xl -text-primary"></i>

```

Output

## Colorful sections

See panels shortcode.

## Embed documents

It’s easy to embed Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and pretty much everything that provides an iframe to use with. The only thing you need to do is use the following code inside your markdown file and replace the iframe from the document you want to embed:

```plain text
<iframe IFRAME CONTENT></iframe>

```

### Google products

For Google products, with your document opened, click File -> Publish to the web. For example, here’s what Google sheets will look like:

<!-- Unsupported block type: image -->

Google Sheets - File - Publish to the web

Choose Embed, check your settings, click on Publish and copy the <iframe>. Then go to your markdown file and wrap the iframe into a <!-- embedded Google Doc removed --> short code. The shortcode makes the iframes the right size on the page and allows them to be resized by the user.

### Google Sheets

Let’s exemplify with this [simple spreadsheet]. Follow the info above to find the iframe:

<!-- Unsupported block type: image -->

Google Sheets - Embed iframe

Copy the code below and paste to your markdown file (leave a blank line above and below it). Then replace the <iframe> with your own:

Markdown

```plain text
<!-- embedded Google Doc removed -->
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jAnvYpRmNu8BISIrkYGTLolOTmlCoKLbuHVWzCXJSY4/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>


```

Output

<!-- Unsupported block type: unsupported -->

<!-- Unsupported block type: divider -->

### Google Slides

Let’s exemplify with this GitLab slide deck. Follow the steps above to find the iframe:

<!-- Unsupported block type: image -->

Google Slides - Embed iframe

Copy the code below and paste to your markdown file (leave a blank line above and below it). Then replace the <iframe> with your own:

Markdown

```plain text
<!-- embedded Google Doc removed -->
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vS_iuMXnp61wlo4amm5nvHr4Ir8VUzisJSBsr7YEL7fKWAiT-9bmehyngtb9TYaFEsFnRokCyIXwsvY/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000"
frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>


```

Output

### Google Docs

### Warning

Embedding Google Docs is not a recommended practice. Prefer converting your document content to markdown instead.

If you need to embed it anyway, follow the same instructions and the same logic as we presented for Google Sheets and Slides, wrapping the <iframe> with a <!-- embedded Google Doc removed --> shortcode:

Markdown

```plain text
<!-- embedded Google Doc removed -->
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mHhOhvvrz7xgUPyn5VWCNuKgew5MRRGZp761B9prPqs/pub?embedded=true"></iframe>


```

## Embed Tweets

X/Twitter changed its usage policy, and might add rate limits. Sometimes, tweets cannot be loaded when embedded, and fail CI/CD builds or the deployed handbook (see the issue discussion). Create a screenshot of the tweet instead, and upload the image into the handbook.

## Embed GitLab Snippets

To embed GitLab Snippets to a markdown file, copy the embed code from your public snippet and paste it in the file.

Markdown

```plain text
<!-- leave a blank line here -->
<script src="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/snippets/1717978.js"></script>
<!-- leave a blank line here -->

```

Output

  hello-world.html    195 B

12345678910

```plain text
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body style="background-color: black; color: white">
  <h1>HELLO WORLD!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

## Other Embeds

Other embeds can be included in the handbook, as outlined in Embed documents. However, due to privacy (especially cookie) concerns, we recommend only embedding from sites outlined in our tech stack, or where “no cookies” can be specified.

## Math

Mathematical and other formulae are supported through the use of LaTeX markup. The Hugo implementation uses the MathJax engine.

The frontmatter parameters must have math: set to true.

```plain text
This is an inline \\(a^\*=x-b^\*\\) equation.
These are block equations:
\\[a^\*=x-b^\*\\]
\\[ a^\*=x-b^\* \\]
\\[
a^\*=x-b^\*
\\]

```

This is an inline a∗=x−b∗a∗=x−b∗ equation.

These are block equations:

a∗=x−b∗a∗=x−b∗

a∗=x−b∗a∗=x−b∗

a∗=x−b∗a∗=x−b∗

## Line length

We do not enforce a line length (MD013).

## Markdown Editors

Please use the editors available on GitLab.com, one of the following code editors, or your preferred code editor to write in markdown.

It is not recommended writing your document in a regular text editor like Google Docs, Microsoft Word, or macOS’ Pages, then copy-pasting to markdown, as it most likely will bring some characters with a different encoding (non UTF-8), which will cause the markdown to not render correctly.

In case you don’t have a choice and need to import a text already written in a text editor, paste it to your markdown file using command+shift+V on a Mac, or control+shift+V on Windows or Linux. You might minimize the cause of trouble by pasting without format. But yet, is not guaranteed it is going to work, so double check your output.

If the document was in Google Docs, you can install the Docs to Markdown add-on, which helps convert the Google Docs to markdown. You’ll likely need to make minor updates or edits to the markdown that the add-on generates.

### Editors Available on GitLab.com

- Web IDE

- Web Editor

### Regular Code Editors

- Visual Studio Code

- Sublime Text

- Vim

- NeoVim

### Markdown editors (type and preview simultaneously)

- Markdown editors for Mac: [MacDown], [iA Writer], [Ulysses]

- In-browser markdown editor: [StackEdit]

- Markdown Tables Generator

If you’re not used to writing markdown, these editors can be helpful. Many editors offer real time previews and while these previews may not be exactly the same as the final result they can be a very good approximation, which gives you a good idea of what the output will be while you type.

[StackEdit] is awesome too, you can work on a markdown file even if you’re away from your computer, or out of resources. It works from every major browser and automatically saves your work to Google Drive.

Do you want a simple way of copying a hyperlink title and address in markdown? The Format Link extension offers a quick and easy way to do this, along with allowing you to customize any number of other formats. View detailed instructions and examples.

If you’re looking for just the ability to copy something as markdown, try these Firefox add-ons or Chrome extensions.
