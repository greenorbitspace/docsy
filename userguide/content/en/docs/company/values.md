### Be respectful of others‚Äô time

Consider the time investment you are asking others to make with meetings and a permission process. Try to avoid meetings, and if one is necessary, try to make attendance optional for as many people as possible. Any meeting should have an agenda linked from the invite, and you should document the outcome. Instead of having people ask permission, trust their judgment and offer a consultation process if they have questions.

### Spend company money like it‚Äôs your own

Every dollar we spend will have to be earned back. Be as frugal with company money as you are with your own. In saying this, we ask team members to weigh the cost of purchases against the value that they will bring to the company.

Consider the degree to which a purchase increases your ability to better accomplish your work and achieve business results relative to cost. Lowering overhead reduces the cost to operate the business and lets us shift spend toward other priority areas.

We have guidelines around this operating principle to help team members better understand our expensing process and expectations.

### Frugality

Amazon states it best with: ‚ÄúAccomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.‚Äù

### Short verbal answers

Give short answers to verbal questions so the other party has the opportunity to ask more or move on.

### Keep broadcasts short

Keep one-to-many written communication short, as mentioned in this HBR study: ‚ÄúA majority say that what they read is frequently ineffective because it‚Äôs too long, poorly organized, unclear, filled with jargon, and imprecise.‚Äù

### Managers of one

We want each team member to be a manager of one who doesn‚Äôt need daily check-ins to achieve their goals. Team members are given the freedom to own projects and initiatives and are trusted to see them through to a successful end.

When team members are managers of one they can have an increased work/life balance, because they are more empowered to make decisions around how they allocate their time throughout each day.

### Freedom and responsibility over rigidity

When possible, we give people the responsibility to make a decision and hold them accountable for that, instead of imposing rules and approval processes. You should have clear objectives and the freedom to work on them as you see fit. Freedom and responsibility are more efficient than rigidly following a process, or creating interdependencies, because they enable faster decision velocity and higher rates of iteration.

When team members have freedom and responsibility over rigidity, they have more room to help others.

### Accept mistakes

Not every problem should lead to a new process to prevent them. Additional processes make all actions more inefficient; a mistake only affects one. Once you have accepted the mistake, learn from it. When team members are free to accept mistakes, they can take more calculated risks.

### Move fast by shipping the minimal valuable change

We value constant improvement by iterating quickly, month after month. If a task is not the smallest viable and valuable thing, cut the scope.

### Embrace change

Adoption of features, user requirements, and the competitive landscape change frequently and rapidly. The most successful companies adapt their roadmap and their organization quickly to keep pace. One of the things that makes this challenging is the impact on our team. People may need to change teams, subject matter, or even who manages them. This can rightly feel disruptive. If we coach ourselves to embrace the positive aspects of change, such as increased opportunity and new things to learn, we can move faster as a company and increase our odds of success. It is important to hold management accountable for being deliberate.

### Efficiency Competency

Competencies are the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) framework for things we need team members to learn. We demonstrate efficiency when we work on the right things, not doing more than needed, and not duplicating work.

## üåê Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging

Diversity, inclusion and belonging are fundamental to the success of GitLab. We aim to make a significant impact in our efforts to foster an environment where everyone can thrive. We are designing a multidimensional approach to ensure that GitLab is a place where people from every background and circumstance feel like they belong and can contribute. We actively chose to build a culture that is inclusive and supports all team members equally in the process of achieving their professional goals. We work to make everyone feel welcome and to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in our community and company.

### Bias towards asynchronous communication

Take initiative to operate asynchronously whenever possible. This shows care and consideration for those who may not be in the same time zone, are traveling outside of their usual time zone, or are structuring their day around pressing commitments at home or in their community.

This is demonstrated by communicating recordings of meetings, using GitLab Issues and Merge Requests rather than texts, calls, or Slack messages, and being sensitive to local holidays and vacation statuses. Encourage others to default to documentation rather than pressuring others to be online outside of their working hours.

### Embracing uncomfortable ideas and conversations

Part of embracing diversity is a willingness to embrace often uncomfortable conversations and situations. This concept is also at the core of inclusion and helping to eliminate the problems that are faced by certain GitLab team members who may not be in the majority.

We believe that being willing to embrace discomfort is the path forward to a safe, balanced and inclusive work place for all. Challenge yourself, challenge your own pre-set notions and ideas about different cultures or things you don‚Äôt understand. When we are willing to embrace being uncomfortable, we can focus on actually fixing the issues at hand rather than simply ‚Äúappearing to care‚Äù.

### Understanding the impact of microaggressions

Microaggressions are much more than merely rude or insensitive comments. They can wear people down by slowly chipping away their sense of belonging/safety/inclusion over time. What is a microaggression?

> 

At GitLab we believe that everyone is entitled to a safe working space where they can express who they are and participate in conversations without worry of being spoken to in a harmful way, given that we want to encourage everyone to be mindful of what is a microaggression and be mindful of their potential impact.

### Seek diverse perspectives

We believe that team members seeking feedback from a diverse group of team members, inside and outside of their group or function, leads to better decisions and a greater sense of team member belonging. For more guidance on how we define Diversity, please refer to GitLab‚Äôs definition of Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging. Feedback from a more heterogenous group often leads to better business outcomes as we incorporate diverse perspectives and uncover unconscious bias.

An example of this operating principle in action showcases the value of actively seeking diverse perspectives. The term ‚ÄúBrag Document‚Äù was used to describe when individuals documented their accomplishments. Documenting accomplishments is critical to team member development. However, team members had the psychological safety to raise the question of whether or not the title of the document made some feel uncomfortable. In an effort to seek a diverse perspective, a survey was conducted in one of the Team Member and Advocacy Resource Group (TMRG) channels. The poll results showed that 100% of those polled preferred a different title and the title was changed.

### Make family feel welcome

One of the unique elements to an all-remote culture is the ability to visit a person‚Äôs home while collaborating. If the tenor of the meeting allows, feel welcome to invite your family members or pets to drop by and greet your colleagues. Be mindful of language and use of profanity to encourage a family-friendly environment.

### Shift working hours for a cause

Caregiving, outreach programs, and community service do not conveniently wait for regular business hours to conclude. If there‚Äôs a cause or community effort taking place, feel welcome to work with your manager and shift your working hours to be available during a period where you‚Äôll have the greatest impact for good. For colleagues supporting others during these causes, document everything and strive to post recordings so it‚Äôs easy for them to catch up.

### Be a mentor

People feel more included when they‚Äôre supported. To encourage this, and to support diversified learning across departments, consider GitLab‚Äôs Internship for Learning program.

### Culture fit is a bad excuse

We don‚Äôt hire based on culture or select candidates because we‚Äôd like to have a drink with them. We hire and reward team members based on our shared values as detailed on this page. We want a values fit, not a culture fit. We want cultural diversity instead of cultural conformity. Said differently: ‚Äúculture add‚Äù > ‚Äúculture fit‚Äù or ‚Äúhire for culture contribution‚Äù since our mission is that everyone can contribute.

### Religion and politics at work

We generally avoid discussing politics or religion in public forums because it is easy to alienate people that have a minority opinion. This doesn‚Äôt mean we never discuss these topics. Because we value diversity, inclusion and belonging, and want all team members to feel welcome and contribute equally, we encourage free discussion of operational decisions that can move us toward being a more inclusive company.

There is sometimes a grey area where advocating for diversity and political activities may intersect. Team members should use discretion in grey area communications, because a culture of belonging requires us to be respectful of the broad spectrum of views within our work environment. What does this mean in practice? Please feel empowered to share information that highlights diversity, inclusion and belonging issues and how GitLab and GitLab team members can get involved. In line with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, avoid posting articles that reference specific political figures or parties.

While it is acceptable for individuals to bring up politics and religion in social contexts such as coffee chats and real-life meetups with other coworkers (with the goal to understand and not judge), always be aware of potential sensitivities, exercise your best judgment, and make sure you stay within the boundaries of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.

We‚Äôre a global company where perspectives and local norms may differ from culture to culture. Diversity, inclusion and belonging is about broad inclusion at a worldwide level. If there is a question or concern, please reach out to diversityinclusion@gitlab.com or #diversity_inclusion_and_belonging.

### Quirkiness

Unexpected and unconventional things make life more interesting. Celebrate and encourage quirky gifts, habits, behavior, and points of view. Open source is a great way to interact with interesting people. We try to hire people who think work is a great way to express themselves.

### Building a safe community

Do not make jokes or unfriendly remarks about characteristics of the people who make up GitLab and how they identify. Everyone has the right to feel safe when working for GitLab and/or as a part of the GitLab community. We do not tolerate abuse, harassment, exclusion, discrimination, or retaliation by/of any community members, including our team members. You can always refuse to deal with people who treat you badly and get out of situations that make you feel uncomfortable.

### Unconscious bias

We recognize that unconscious bias is something that affects everyone and that the effect it has on us as humans and our company is large. We are responsible for understanding our own implicit biases and helping others understand theirs. We are continuously working on getting better at this topic.

### Inclusive benefits

We list our Parental Leave publicly so people don‚Äôt have to ask during interviews.

### Inclusive language & pronouns

Use inclusive language. For example, prefer ‚ÄúHi everybody‚Äù or ‚ÄúHi people‚Äù to ‚ÄúHi guys‚Äù, and ‚Äúthey‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhe/she‚Äù. While there are several good guides from folks like 18f, University of Calgary, and Buffer on using inclusive language, we don‚Äôt keep an exhaustive list. When new possibly non-inclusive words arise, we prefer to be proactive and look for an alternative. If your goal is to be inclusive, it is more effective to make a small adjustment in the vocabulary when some people have a problem with it, rather than making a decision to not change it because some people don‚Äôt think it is a problem. And if you make a mistake (e.g. accidentally using the wrong pronoun or an outdated phrase), acknowledge it, apologize gracefully and move on; there is no need to dwell on it, and you can work to avoid making that mistake in the future. Please also visit our Gender and Sexual-orientation Identity Definitions and FAQ page if you have questions around pronouns and other topics related to gender / sexual orientation.

### Learn how to pronounce other people‚Äôs names

We attach part of our identity to our names, and if it is mispronounced it can feel less inclusive. If it happens repeatedly, you may be unintentionally sending a message to that person that you are not interested in learning how to pronounce their name correctly. This applies to everyone you are in contact with: team members, customers, candidates for jobs, and anyone else.

People whose name is repeatedly mispronounced might feel unimportant or self-conscious, and might not speak up about it. Other negative behaviors include giving a person a nickname without their permission, or actively avoiding using their name in sync calls.

It might be challenging to pronounce names from a different language or culture than your own, but with some effort, name pronunciation can be learned by anyone. Some ways to achieve this are:

- Ask the person for help in a private space: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I don‚Äôt think I am pronouncing your name correctly. Can you help me with the correct pronunciation?‚Äù

- Use the written and recorded pronunciation tools in Slack.

- Use online tools such as videos recorded on YouTube or NameShouts.

- Practice the pronunciation with a friend or team member who knows the correct pronunciation.

- Always avoid making jokes or comments about how it is difficult to pronounce their name.

Use of nicknames

Some people might choose to use a nickname, for example: ‚ÄúBob‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúRobert‚Äù. As long as this is their choice this is perfectly acceptable. We should avoid assigning a nickname to a person without their permission.

Slack pronunciation features

Slack has two features to help with this issue: the phonetic name pronunciation field and the ability to record your own name pronunciation audio clip. We encourage all team members to complete both of these. Update them by editing your profile.

### Inclusive interviewing

This is documented on our page about interviewing.

### Inclusive meetings

Be consciously inclusive in meetings by giving everyone present an opportunity to talk and present their points of view. This can be especially important in a remote setting.

With internal meetings, consider using an agenda document for questions. For example, with GitLab Group Conversations, every meeting has a numbered list that GitLab team members can add questions to. During the meeting, questions are answered in turn and discussions noted in the same document. Sometimes, these documents can have so much traffic (during the meeting) such that only a limited number of people can edit the document. In these situations, those who have questions should post on zoom chat and those who can edit the document should help copy the question over to the document. In addition, those who can edit the document should also post in zoom chat to see if anyone has any questions that they could help add to the document so that meeting attendees are more empowered to contribute to the conversation.

Customers are not used to working in this way. To promote inclusion with customers: ask participants for their goals; make sure during demos that you pause for question; leave time for discussion.

### Inclusive and fair policy to regions with fewer employees

Being globally distributed has the benefit that someone can cover for you when you are off work. However, population density is not balanced across timezones. Policies should remain fair to those in less dense regions.

For example, the Asia Pacific region covers more timezones but has fewer team members. If we use an algorithm to assign tasks to those in later timezones, all American tasks would fall on the fewer Asia Pacific employees. This can damage belonging and inclusivity and should be avoided.

When planning an event, the organizer should cater for location density differences to maximize participation in all regions.

### See Something, Say Something

As a globally-dispersed company, we have team members from many different backgrounds and cultures. That means it is important for each of us to use great judgment in being respectful and inclusive of our teammates. At the same time, we may sometimes not fully realize we have said or done something to offend someone. It is important that our teammates hold each other accountable and let them know if they have unintentionally or intentionally done something so they can learn and gain additional understanding of perspectives different from our own. It is also important that our teammates don‚Äôt feel excluded or minimized by the words we use or the things we do. Thus, we all need to speak up when we see something that isn‚Äôt respectful or inclusive.

### Embracing Neurodiversity

Neurodiversity refers to variations in the human brain regarding learning, attention, sociability, mood, and other mental functions. There are various neurodevelopmental conditions, like autism, ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia, cognitive impairment, schizophrenia, bipolarity, and other styles of neurodivergent functioning. While neurodivergent individuals often bring unique skills and abilities which can be harnessed for a competitive advantage in many fields (for example, cybersecurity), neurodivergent individuals are often discriminated against. Due to non-inclusive hiring practices, they sometimes have trouble making it through traditional hiring processes. Neurodiversity inclusion best practices benefit everyone, and at GitLab, everyone can contribute. The handbook, values, strategy, and interviewing processes must support the ability for everyone to thrive.

At GitLab we embrace Neurodiversity through adopting a variety of different work styles and communication styles, and we lean into transparency, asynchronous as a default working style, and pre-filled meeting agendas. These best practices become even more important when embracing neurodiversity. Providing multiple ways to consume information (written / video / audio) allows everyone to contribute independent of their preferred comprehension style. It is important to ask team members specifically what their preferred communication method is in order to provide them information in a format that is easily consumable for them.

Remember, brains work differently and always assume positive intent, even if someone behaves in an unexpected way. While it may be an unexpected behavior to you, it may not be unexpected to the individual exhibiting the behavior. That is the beauty and value of diversity, embracing differences and becoming stronger and better as a result.

We also recommend that all team members review the Reasonable Accommodation process. A Reasonable Accommodation for a team member could include noise-cancelling headphones, scheduling smaller group session zoom calls, providing very explicit and precise instructions and due-dates when given tasks, or providing a variety of supportive software tools.

The most important thing that managers can do is facilitate an environment in which all team members feel psychologically safe enough to make requests for what they need in order to do their job.

### Family and friends first, work second

Long-lasting relationships are the rocks of life, and come before work. As someone said in our #thanks channel after helping a family member for five days after a hurricane: ‚ÄúTHANK YOU to GitLab for providing a culture where ‚Äúfamily first‚Äù is truly meant‚Äù. Use the hashtag: #FamilyAndFriends1st

### Equity not just equality

Equity vs. Equality: What‚Äôs the Difference?

### Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging Competency

Competencies are the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) framework for things we need team members to learn. We demonstrate diversity, inclusion and belongings when we foster an environment where everyone can thrive and ensuring that GitLab is a place where people from every background and circumstance feel like they belong and can contribute.

## üë£ Iteration

Merriam-Webster defines iteration as the ‚Äúthe action or a process of iterating or repeating: such as a procedure in which repetition of a sequence of operations yields results successively closer to a desired result.‚Äù At GitLab, we iterate to do the smallest valuable thing to get fast feedback and efficiently reach a desired end goal. Feedback can be from internal users (dogfooding), a limited number of external users (through our early access program), or through feedback from our broader user community. We validate each iteration and adjust, but not at the expense of the user experience that we deliver to our customers.

When we iterate at GitLab, we break up the work that we know we need to do into smaller chunks to iterate toward a targeted end state:

1. Merge in codebase

1. Dogfood

1. Have some external users (early access program)

1. Ensure global optimization (use standardized systems)

1. Plan beyond the iteration

Iteration does not require us to ship features that are open to all users from day one. Feedback can come from internal users or a limited number of external users (early access program). Moving through the release process is not iteration though. Iteration is also not a replacement for having a plan. We expect you to know where you are going, but you can iterate to get there.

An iteration might be additive (adding something) or subtractive (removing something). If you make suggestions that can be excluded from the first iteration, turn them into a separate issue that you link.

While you should have a clear vision of the desired outcome and how it addresses a customer pain point or improves the user experience, be efficient in your planning. Unless you identify important cross-functional interdependencies, focus detailed planning on the first step. It might feel you are moving too slowly; however, planning is critical in order to ensure you can move fast when implementing. You‚Äôre doing it right if you feel that you have shipped the minimal feature set in the first iteration. This value is the one people most underestimate when they join GitLab. The impact, both on your work process and on how much you achieve, is greater than anticipated. Frequently, the simplest version that provides value turns out to be the best one.

Many people who join GitLab say they already practice iteration. But this is the value that is the hardest to understand and adopt. People are trained that if you don‚Äôt deliver a perfect or polished thing, there will be a problem. If you do just one piece of something, you have to come back to it. Doing the whole thing seems more efficient, even though it isn‚Äôt. If the complete picture is not clear, your work might not be perceived as you want it to be perceived. It seems better to make a comprehensive product. They see other GitLab team members being really effective with iteration but don‚Äôt know how to make the transition, and it‚Äôs hard to shake the fear that constant iteration can lead to shipping lower-quality work or a worse product. In reality, it is possible to ship a minimally valuable product while continuing to adhere to the documented quality standards.

The way to resolve this is to write down only what value you can add with the time you have for this project right now. That might be 5 minutes or 2 hours. Think of what you can complete in that time that would improve the current situation. Iteration can be uncomfortable, even painful. If you‚Äôre doing iteration correctly, it should be. Reverting work back to a previous state is positive, not negative. We‚Äôre quickly getting feedback and learning from it. Making a small change prevented a bigger revert and made it easier to revert.

However, if we take smaller steps and ship smaller, simpler features, we get feedback sooner. Instead of spending time working on the wrong feature or going in the wrong direction, we can ship the smallest product, receive fast feedback, and course correct. People might ask why something was not perfect. In that case, mention that it was an iteration, you spent only ‚Äúx‚Äù amount of time on it, and that the next iteration will contain ‚Äúy‚Äù and be ready on ‚Äúz‚Äù.

Iteration enables results and efficiency.

<!-- Unsupported block type: video -->

In the GitLab Unfiltered video embedded above, GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij shares key operating principles to reinforce iteration in an organization.

### Start with a long-term vision

Iteration involves driving results in pursuit of a long-term vision. While the intermediate goals may change as we iterate, we are unlikely to be successful if we don‚Äôt start with a vision of what we are working toward. Shipping that vision in iterations allows us to learn from customers using it and adjust the vision if needed. Iteration for the sake of iteration can lead to inefficiencies and not deliver desired results.

### Iteration is no substitute for planning

Iteration without a plan can lead to inefficiencies and a subpar customer experience. Before iterating we need to plan. A plan should include:

1. Time-bound objective: Where we want to be in a year

1. UX: User experience we are working toward

1. Quality: What quality is sufficient quality, inclusive of security

1. Success metric: Usage we want at a specific time

1. Data schema: The data schema we need to measure progress towards project goals

1. GTM plan: How we want to go to market

1. Enablement: When we‚Äôd plan to train and enable the support and field teams

1. Marketing: When we‚Äôd launch marketing (doesn‚Äôt have to be at release)

1. Secure by design: default to the most secure configuration

### The release process is not iteration

Moving through the release process is not iteration.

The release process can include:

- Dogfooding

- Early access

- Incremental release using a feature flag

- Development stage progression (such as experiment to beta)

- Release

- Announcement

While development stages can be used to indicate release progress, is not itself iteration.

### Iterate toward global maximum

If we are not aware of interdependencies beyond our team, and we are not collaborating with others across the organization, we risk deliverables that settle into a ‚Äúlocal maximum‚Äù of quality, richness, and efficiency. This localization is largely defined by team structure and organizational boundaries. While an iteration can take place within a single team, that team is responsible for identifying inter-dependencies and proactively communicating and aligning with other teams working on related projects. This helps ensure that iterations are not ‚Äúhalf-baked‚Äù and align with work being done across the entire organization.

### Don‚Äôt wait

Don‚Äôt wait on the small things. When you have something of value like a potential blog post or a small fix, implement it straight away. Right now, everything is fresh in your head and you have the motivation. Inspiration is perishable. Don‚Äôt wait until you have a better version. Don‚Äôt wait until you record a better video. Don‚Äôt wait for an event (like GitLab Summit). Inventory that isn‚Äôt released is a liability since it has to be managed, becomes outdated, and you miss out on the feedback you would have received had you implemented it straight away. When we don‚Äôt wait we signal intent to others that we have a purpose to resolve something. Note: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt wait‚Äù should not be used as a justification for not iterating toward the global maximum or at expense of the plan. If there are interdependencies to be considered or the iteration is customer facing, slow down and ensure that we are considering what is best for GitLab and our customers.

### Set a due date

We always try to set a due date. If needed, we cut scope. If we have something planned for a specific date, we make that date. For example we shipped over 133 monthly releases. But every one of them doesn‚Äôt contain all the features we planned. If we planned an announcement for a certain date, we might announce less or indicate what is still uncertain. But we set a due date because having something out there builds trust and gives us better feedback.

### Cleanup over sign-off

As discussed in Sid‚Äôs interview on iteration, waiting for approval can slow things down. We can prevent this with automation (such as tests of database migration performance) or clean-up after the fact (refactor a Pajamas if something was added that isn‚Äôt coherent), but we try to ensure that people don‚Äôt need to wait for sign-off. As iteration does not require us to ship to all users on day one, we can clean up after an internal or beta release to mitigate the negative impact to all customers.

### Start off by impacting the fewest users possible

Iteration does not mean being open to all users from day one. If you do a gradual rollout of your change, prefer:

- Few users over many users

- Internal users (dogfooding) over external users

- Environments with fast feedback (SaaS) over slow feedback (self-managed)

### Reduce cycle time

Short iterations reduce our cycle time. Merging frequently also prevents merge conflicts.

### Work as part of the community

Small iterations make it easier to work with the wider community. Their work looks more like our work, and our work is also quicker to receive feedback.

### Minimal Valuable Change (MVC)

We encourage MVCs to be as small as possible. Always look to make the quickest change possible to improve the user‚Äôs outcome. If you validate that the change adds more value than what is there now, then do it. This may be additive (adding something) or subtractive (removing something). No need to wait for something more robust. More information is in the product handbook, but this applies to everything we do in all functions. Specifically for product MVCs, there is additional responsibility to validate with customers that we‚Äôre adding useful functionality without obvious bugs or usability issues.

### Make a proposal

If you need to decide something as a team, make a concrete proposal instead of calling a meeting to get everyone‚Äôs input. Having a proposal will be a much more effective use of everyone‚Äôs time. Every meeting should be a review of a proposal. We should be brainwriting on our own instead of brainstorming out loud. State the underlying problem so that people have enough context to propose reasonable alternatives. The people that receive the proposal should not feel left out and the person making it should not feel bad if a completely different proposal is implemented. Don‚Äôt let your desire to be involved early or to see your solution implemented stand in the way of getting to the best outcome. If you don‚Äôt have a proposal, don‚Äôt let that stop you from highlighting a problem, but please state that you couldn‚Äôt think of a good solution and list any solutions you considered.

By making a proposal you also provide better visibility into the work and the context surrounding it.

In this GitLab Unfiltered video, GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij converses about iteration in engineering, leveraging proposals to break work into smaller components.

### Everything is in draft

At GitLab, we rarely mark any content or proposals as drafts. Everything is always in draft and subject to change. When everything is in draft, contributions from team members as well as the wider community are welcomed. By having everything in draft and assuming others have low context, confusion can be reduced as people have shared access to information.

### Under construction

As we continue to expand the number of users we have, they will continue to expect stability and reliability. We must optimize for the long term without sacrificing stability along the way. This means that users may be inconvenienced in the short term, but current and future users will enjoy a better product in the end.

Educating users on the longer-term plan helps create a shared understanding of how a small change will incrementally grow into something more. For example, we could share how a dropdown will evolve into a much more nuanced solution in the future. We can take the following steps to articulate our plan:

1. Open a feedback issue that provides context about the initial MVC (example)

1. Ensure the direction page articulates a long-term plan (example)

1. Announce the MVC in a release post, link to the feedback issue, and link to the direction page (example)

### Low level of shame when dogfooding

In many organizations, you take a risk when you put forth any work that‚Äôs not perfect, work where you haven‚Äôt spent endless cycles planning for contingencies or counterpoints. Because of this, you‚Äôre incentivized to invest a lot of time and effort into preparing for ‚ÄòWhat if?‚Äô scenarios before any work is presented, even if the release is not customer facing and there is a low level of risk in imperfection.

The downside to that is clear when we are dogfooding: If you do eventually put forth the work, but it needed to be course-corrected a long time ago, you‚Äôve squandered time that you could have spent improving it through iteration.

Having a low level of shame when dogfooding or working internally requires you to combat a natural inclination to conceal work until it‚Äôs perfect, and instead celebrate the small changes.

### Cultural lens

Cultural differences can bring unique challenges and expectations to iteration. For some, expressions like ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect‚Ä¶‚Äù can challenge cultural norms. We encourage you to bring your authentic self and seek shared understanding when iterating. Giving feedback and ensuring psychological safety are necessary for every iterative attempt.

### Focus on improvement

We believe great companies sound negative because they focus on what they can improve, not only on what is working well. In every conversation, inside and outside the company, we should ask a question: What do you think we can improve? This doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt recognize our successes; for example, see our Say Thanks value.

We are positive about the future of the company. We are Short Term Critical And Long Term Optimistic (STeCALTO, for short).

### Be deliberate about scale

First, optimize for speed and results (and be deliberate about how your change affects other processes/functionality); when it is a success, figure out how to scale it. Great examples are in this article by Paul Graham.

### Resist bundling

Resist the urge to bundle a series of smaller iterations so team members don‚Äôt see a project as their last (or best) opportunity to contribute. It‚Äôs tempting to create encompassing projects or initiatives that roll many smaller projects up. This incarnation of scope creep drives up cost, encourages fewer risks, and incentivizes perfection (via longer cycle times) over progress. When we resist bundling, we reduce the risk that work will be canceled due to scale or scope. By resisting bundling we also reduce the coordination needed because fewer people or teams may be involved.

### Make two-way door decisions

Most decisions are easy to reverse. In these cases, the Directly Responsible Individual should go ahead and make them without approval. Only when you can‚Äôt reverse them should there be a more thorough discussion. By embracing iteration and making two-way door decisions, we are more efficient and achieve more results.

### Changing proposals isn‚Äôt iteration

Changing something without shipping it is a revision, not iteration. Only when the change is rolled out to users, whether internal users or a limited customer group, can you learn from feedback. When you‚Äôre changing a proposal based on different opinions, you‚Äôre frequently wasting time; it would be better to roll out a small change quickly and get real world feedback. Never call a revision an iteration because it is almost the opposite.

### Embracing Iteration

In order to embrace iteration, we should have the attitude that we are trying to achieve as much as possible in a small amount of time; it‚Äôs where we land at the end state of an iteration that counts. The benefit of iteration is to get fast feedback from users. Focus on sharing context at the end of the first iteration rather than a hypothetical future state that requires multiple iterations. By embracing iteration we can increase creativity in incremental components.

### Make small merge requests

When you are submitting a merge request for a code change, or a process change in the handbook, keep it as small as possible. If you are adding a new page to the handbook, create the new page with a small amount of initial content, get it merged quickly via Handbook Usage guidelines, and then add additional sections iteratively with subsequent merge requests. Similarly, when adding features to GitLab, consider ways to reduce the scope of the feature before creating the merge request to ensure your merge request is as small as possible.

### Always iterate deliberately

Rapid iteration can get in the way of results if it‚Äôs not thought out; for example, when adjusting our marketing messaging (where consistency is key), product categories (where we‚Äôve set development plans), organizational structure or product scope alignment (where real human stresses and team stability are involved), sales methodologies (where we‚Äôve trained our teams) and this values page (where we use the values to guide all GitLab team members). In those instances, we add additional review to the approval process; not to prohibit, but to be more deliberate in our iteration. The change process is documented in the GitLab Handbook Usage page and takes place via merge request approvals.

### 12 things that are not iteration

Iteration is often counterintuitive and difficult to do. To clarify what an iteration is, it helps to see examples of what is not an iteration. Below are 12 examples of things we‚Äôve seen mistaken as iteration, but don‚Äôt meet our definition of iteration.

1. Reducing quality, or lowering goal posts

1. Avoiding or reducing documentation

1. Compromising on security

1. Delivering something that‚Äôs not the recommended path or on by default

1. Shipping something of no value

1. An excuse to focus on unimportant items

1. Moving through the release process

1. Revisions you don‚Äôt ship or publish

1. An excuse to impose unrealistically tight timelines

1. An excuse to avoid planning

1. Imposing long hours

1. Expecting others to fix your work

In this GitLab Unfiltered video, GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij elaborates on each of these 12 things that are not iteration.

### Iteration Competency

Competencies are the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) framework for things we need team members to learn. We demonstrate iteration when we do the smallest viable and valuable thing, get it out quickly for feedback, and make changes based that feedback.

## üëÅÔ∏è Transparency

Be open about as many things as possible. By making information public, we can reduce the threshold to contribution and make collaboration easier. Use public issue trackers, projects, and repositories when possible. Transparency is not communication. Just because something exists in the handbook or elsewhere doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be communicated again or in a more robust fashion to the people who need to understand or acknowledge it. On a personal level, be direct when sharing information, and admit when you‚Äôve made a mistake or were wrong. When something goes wrong, it is a great opportunity to say ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the kaizen moment here?‚Äù and find a better way without hurt feelings.

Even as a public company, we know that our value of transparency will be key to our success. This value can be hard to follow at times. You might ask yourself: what should be shared, how much to share, whether or not to speak up but definitely take the time to always opt for maximum transparency by adhering to the operating principles below. Often, company values get diluted as they grow, most likely because they do not write anything down. But we will make sure our values scale with the company. As a public company, we declare everyone in the company as an insider, which allows us to remain transparent internally about our numbers, etc. Everything else that can be transparent will continue to be so.

When there are exceptions, material that is not public by default is documented.

### Public by default

Everything at GitLab is public by default. The public process does two things: allows others to benefit from the conversation and acts as a filter. Since there is only a limited amount of time, we prioritize conversations that a wider audience can benefit from.

One example of transparency at GitLab is the public repository of this website that also contains this company handbook. Others include the GitLab CE and GitLab EE issue trackers, as well as marketing and infrastructure. Transparency creates awareness for GitLab, allows us to recruit people that care about our values, gets us more and faster feedback from people outside the company, and makes it easier to collaborate with them. It is also about sharing great software, documentation, examples, lessons, and processes with the whole community and the world in the spirit of open source, which we believe creates more value than it captures.

In line with our value of transparency and being public by default, all GitLab team member profiles should be public. Public profiles also enable broader collaboration and efficiencies between teams. To do so, please make sure that the checkbox under the Private profile option is unchecked in your profile settings. If you do not feel comfortable with your full name or location on your profile, please change it to what feels appropriate to you as these are displayed even on private profiles.

Because we are public by default and have the SAFE framework we don‚Äôt need to make cases for why things should be transparent. If something is unSAFE and needs to remain not public it can be.

### Not public

We make information public by default because transparency is one of our values. However it is most important to focus on results. Therefore, a category of information is public unless there is a reason for it not to be. If something is not public, there should be a reference in the handbook that states a confidential decision was taken with a link to our Not Public guidelines, unless GitLab Legal and Corporate Affairs believes it carries undue risk. We document what is not public by default on our communication page.

If you believe something shouldn‚Äôt be public that currently is (or vice versa), then make a merge request to the relevant page(s) suggesting the change so that you can collaborate with others and discuss with the DRI. When content contains information which is not public it is recommended to remove the specific sections which are not public, put them on their own page in the internal handbook, and then link out to that with a ‚Äúnot public/internal only‚Äù note. Always share publicly what we can.

When information is not public, it may also be treated as limited access, only shared with certain GitLab roles, teams, or team members due to privacy considerations, contractual obligation, or other reasons that the author or DRI can specify. Certain kinds of information default to limited access, including details about team members or customers who did not give permission to share the information.

Most companies become non-transparent over time because they don‚Äôt accept any mistakes. Instead, we should always err on the side of transparency when there is a choice to be made between caution or inaction, and transparency. If we make a mistake, we now know what the limits of transparency are for the company and we should document this. The only exception to this rule would be in the case when there are legal concerns.

Because some information is not public the public information can be lacking some context. We should be cognizant of that.

### Directness

Being direct is about being transparent with each other. We try to channel our inner Ben Horowitz by being both straightforward and kind. Feedback is always about your work and not your person. That doesn‚Äôt mean it will be easy to give or receive it.

### Articulate when you change your mind

If you state one thing, and then change course and support a different direction, point, or outcome, articulate this. It is OK to have your position changed by new data. Articulating that an earlier stance is not your current stance provides clarity to others and encourages data-driven decision making.

### Surface issues constructively

Be transparent to the right people (up) at the right time (when still actionable). If you make a mistake, don‚Äôt worry; correct it and proactively let the affected party, your team, and the CEO know what happened, how you corrected it, and how‚Äîif needed‚Äîyou changed the process to prevent future mistakes.

### Transparency is most valuable if you continue to do it when there are costs

We practice transparency even when hiding the facts would be easier. For example, many companies do not give you the real reason why they declined your application because it increases the chance of legal action. We want to only reject people for the right reasons and we want to give them the opportunity to grow by getting this feedback. Therefore, we‚Äôll accept the increased risk of holding ourselves to a high standard of making decisions and do the right thing by telling them what we thought. Other examples are being transparent about security incidents and participating in and contributing to Live Broadcasts.

Transparency has costs (distraction, mis-interpretation, etc.) but also great benefits (productivity, hiring, retention, brand awareness, etc). We should carefully weigh the tradeoff between costs and benefits, to prevent a knee-jerk reaction to reduce transparency when it has costs.

### Single Source of Truth

By having most company communications and work artifacts be public to the Internet, we have one single source of truth for all GitLab team members, users, customers, and other community members. We don‚Äôt need separate artifacts with different permissions for different people.

### Findability

Our transparency value means more than just making information accessible to all. In order to improve performance it‚Äôs important that we not only ensure information is accessible, but also ensure it flows to the correct places and is findable by those who need it. Focusing on information flow will ensure you, for example, utilize multi-modal communication, or that you keep your stakeholders informed of changes by posting links to MRs in Slack.

### Say why, not just what

Transparent changes have the reasons for the change laid out clearly along with the change itself. This leads to fewer questions later on because people already have some understanding. A change with no public explanation can lead to a lot of extra rounds of questioning, which is less efficient.

This also helps with institutional memory: a year from now when you want to know why a decision was made, or not, the issue or MR that has the decision also shares why the decision was made. This is related to Chesterton‚Äôs fence - it‚Äôs much easier to suggest removing or changing something if you know why it exists in the first place.

If you use generalized terms such as ‚Äúindustry standard‚Äù or ‚Äúbest practices,‚Äù be sure to give context, as without context they can be seen as potentially vague or opaque.

Similarly, merely stating a single value isn‚Äôt a great explanation for why we are making a particular decision. Many things could be considered ‚Äúiteration‚Äù or ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù that don‚Äôt match our definition of those values. Try to link to an operating principle of the value or provide more context, instead of just saying a single value‚Äôs name.

Saying why and not just what enables discussion around topics that may impact more than one value; for instance, when weighing the efficiency of boring solutions with the focus on customer results. When decisions align with all of our values, they are easy to discuss and decide. When there are multiple values involved, using our values hierarchy and directly discussing the tradeoffs is easier with more context.

Articulating why also helps people understand how something changed when you articulate that you changed your mind.

Saying why does not mean justifying a decision against all other suggestions. The DRI is responsible for their decision. The DRI is not responsible for convincing other people, but they should be able to articulate their reasoning for the change.

When a GitLab Team Member comes across an ask or material (MR, handbook, etc.) that does not provide a ‚Äúwhy‚Äù with sufficient context, the Team Member is responsible for getting the why and, if needed, working with the DRI to ensure that it is adequately documented and communicated to give context to other team members. In the absence of a why, team members may speculate the why. This is something that can lead to disruption and inefficiency.

### Reproducibility

Enable everybody involved to come to the same conclusion as you. This not only involves reasoning, but also providing, for example: raw data and not just plots; scripts to automate tasks and not just the work they have done; and documenting steps while analyzing a problem. Do your best to make the line of thinking transparent to others, even if they may disagree.

### Transparency Competency

Competencies are the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) framework for things we need team members to learn. We demonstrate transparency when we are open with as many things as possible reducing the threshold to contribution and make collaboration easier.

<!-- Unsupported block type: table -->

## Why have values

Our values provide guidelines on how to behave and are written to be actionable. They help us describe the type of behavior that we expect from GitLab team members. They help us to know how to behave in the organization and what to expect from others.

Values provide a framework for distributed decision making, detailed in GitLab‚Äôs TeamOps management philosophy. They allow individuals to determine what to do without asking their manager and they allow teams to make consistent decisions. When teams across the organization reference the same values in their decision making, there is consistency in how decisions are made. This ensures that our culture remains driven by our values.

Lastly, values create a conscious culture that is designed to help you prosper and experience exceptional personal growth through work.

## Five dysfunctions

Our values also help us to prevent the five dysfunctions:

1. Fear of conflict Seeking artificial harmony over constructive passionate debate => prevented by transparency, specifically directness and collaboration, specifically short toes

1. Absence of trust Unwilling to be vulnerable within the group => prevented by collaboration, specifically kindness

1. Avoidance of accountability Ducking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behavior which sets low standards => prevented by results, iteration, and transparency

1. Inattention to results Focusing on personal success, status, and ego before team success => prevented by results

1. Lack of commitment Feigning buy-in for group decisions creates ambiguity throughout the organization => prevented by transparency, specifically directness

Some dysfunctions are not addressed directly by our values; for example, trust is not one of our values. Similar to happiness, trust is something that is an outcome, not something you can strive for directly. We hope that the way we work and our values will instill trust, instead of mandating it from people; trust is earned, not given.

## Operating principles

Operating principles are behaviors that empower GitLab team members to definitively live out a given value. They clarify what a given core value means and looks like at GitLab. Understanding this distinction is critical to thriving at GitLab, particularly for newer team members who may be familiar with a prior organization‚Äôs interpretation of iteration or collaboration (as examples).

Process for removing operating principles

Values are not just things we do, but things that actively drive good behavior. When we remove them it doesn‚Äôt mean we stopped believing in it, just that it wasn‚Äôt actively helping to drive behavior. If we don‚Äôt prune our operating principles, then we will be like every other company: things that make sense but are not leading to a better culture.

1. To remove an operating principle from the Handbook page, submit your change through a merge request and explain your reasons in the merge request description.

1. The GitLab Value Handbook Page owner must approve and merge the request.

Mention the specific value

Most companies have a list of values. In companies without strong values, folks often use generalizations when they refer to values. For example, ‚Äúnot a value add‚Äù or ‚Äúscored well on values during our interview.‚Äù In companies with strong values, folks name the specific, relevant value as it applies to a given topic or situation. Values are only powerful when they are individually understood and applied by team members.

## How to scale the business while preserving GitLab values?

For certain business decisions or projects (such as compensation and end-point management ), GitLab team members may have a lot of opinions and interest, and they want to provide their feedback and comments. On the other hand, it might be challenging for the project DRI to digest and respond to all these inputs. What should you do in this scenario?

Everyone can contribute at GitLab. We encourage team members to share feedback and leave comments on issues. Leaving feedback and comments shows that team members care about a topic and about GitLab as a company. These perspectives may also uncover potential risks and problems in the project.

There shouldn‚Äôt be a ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt they have their job to do?‚Äù type of response. Furthermore, we shouldn‚Äôt judge team members who are perceived as being the ‚Äúsqueaky wheel.‚Äù At GitLab, we measure impact, not activity. As long as a team member is producing required results, they are empowered to decide how to spend their time.

On the other hand, as GitLab grows in size, we need to make decisions and the decisions may not be agreed to by everyone. If a decision or project is sensitive or controversial, and receives large amounts of feedback, it can be challenging for the project DRI to handle. In these cases, it‚Äôs best to have time-boxed feedback built into timelines.

In a hypothetical example where a DRI needs to decide between red and gold potatoes for a stew, they would create an issue with the following sentiment:

> 

This method has shown itself to be effective at soliciting productive feedback that doesn‚Äôt derail a timeline while ensuring team members feel heard.

## Why our values are public

Companies are encouraged to copy and implement GitLab‚Äôs values. They are Creative Commons and can be copied verbatim.

We make our values public for the same reasons we make our OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and strategy public. There is great power and efficiency in teams who share company values. Concealing values until after someone is hired into an organization is not a wise strategy.

Not everyone will see our values and feel aligned with them, and that‚Äôs OK. By making values public, it shows respect for the time of job seekers who conduct due diligence on prospective employers. When people who are aligned with GitLab‚Äôs values apply for an open vacancy, this allows our hiring teams to more efficiently move candidates through the interview process.

In a GitLab Unfiltered interview on values, GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij offers the following context.

> 

## Hierarchy

Occasionally, values can contradict each other. It‚Äôs useful to keep in mind this hierarchy to resolve confusion about what to do in a specific circumstance, while remaining consistent with our core values.

Think of the hierarchy as a weighting system. Values higher in the hierarchy do not automatically override values lower in the hierarchy. Here are some examples:

- If a change impacts Transparency positively but impacts Efficiency negatively in roughly the same amount, we would move ahead since Transparency is higher in the hierarchy than Efficiency.

- If a change has a massive positive impact on Diversity but negatively impacts Iteration, we would move ahead even though Diversity is lower in the hierarchy than Iteration because the overall impact is more positive than negative.

## Updating our values

Our values are updated frequently and as needed. Everyone is welcome to make a suggestion to improve them. To update: make a merge request and assign it to the CEO. If you‚Äôre a team member or in the core team please post a link to the MR in the #values Slack channel. If you‚Äôre not part of those groups, please send a direct X/Twitter message to @sytses.

## How do we reinforce our values

Whatever behavior you reward will become your values. We reinforce our values by:

1.

The most important moments to reinforce our values are decisions which affect individual team members most: hiring, promotions, and bonuses, which is why every promotion document at GitLab is shared with the entire company and uses the values as its core structure.

In negative feedback, we should be specific about what the problem is. For example, saying someone is ‚Äúnot living the values‚Äù isn‚Äôt helpful.

> 

## What to do if values aren‚Äôt being lived out

Value erosion can occur when indifference and apathy are tolerated. It can also occur when individuals justify undesired behaviors by interpreting values as ‚Äúme values‚Äù rather than ‚Äúcompany values.‚Äù For example, a team member may speak to the importance of personal efficiency in order to justify not collaborating professionally with peers. This is not what we expect from team members in terms of efficiency and collaboration.

If you feel that values are not being lived out in a given scenario, speak up and ask for context in a respectful manner. Navigating value conflicts starts with assuming positive intent from other team members. Offer links to relevant values and/or operating principles when discussing the issue. If there is confusion or disagreement about the interpretation of a value, please surface the discussion in GitLab‚Äôs #values Slack channel (for GitLab team members) or @-mentioning @gitlab on X/Twitter (for those who do not work at GitLab).

In a GitLab Unfiltered interview on values, GitLab co-founder Sid Sijbrandij offers the following context.

> 

## Permission to play

From our values we excluded some behaviors that are obvious; we call them our permission to play behavior:

1. Be truthful and honest.

1. Be dependable and reliable.

1. Try to keep promises. If you might not keep a promise, proactively communicate as soon as you suspect it.

1. Be deserving of the trust of our team members, users and customers.

1. Be committed to the success of the whole organization.

1. Act in the best interest of the company, our team members, our customers, users, and investors.

1. Make the best decisions for GitLab.

1. Act in accordance with the law.

1. Don‚Äôt show favoritism as it breeds resentment, destroys employee morale, and creates disincentives for good performance. Seek out ways to be fair to everyone.

## Playing politics is counter to GitLab values

We don‚Äôt want people to play politics at GitLab.

An example of politics is people discussing a proposal and being overly focused on whose proposal it is. This is a manifestation of the Belief Bias, where we judge an argument‚Äôs strength not by how strongly it supports the conclusion but by how strongly we support the conclusion. Proposals should be weighed on their merits and not on who proposed them. Another example is people being promoted based on others liking them or having a lot of alliances. We want people to be promoted based on their results. We value collaboration, but that‚Äôs different from being promoted just because people like you.

Below are some attributes of political and non-political work environments. GitLab plans to maintain a non-political one.

## Values make choices

Values make and clarify choices. A well-chosen value has a defensible opposite. Apple, for example, values secrecy over transparency and product perfection over iteration. They are successful building around our counter values ‚Äî although the result is a very different company.

<!-- Unsupported block type: video -->

## What is not a value

- All-remote isn‚Äôt a value. It is something we do because it helps to practice our values of transparency, efficiency, results, and diversity, inclusion & belonging.

## Questions from new team members

During every GitLab 101 session with new hires we discuss our values. We document the questions and answers to Frequently Asked Questions about the GitLab Culture.

New team members should read GitLab‚Äôs guide to starting a new remote role, and reference interviews centered on values within the GitLab Unfiltered YouTube channel.

## Mission

Our mission is to enable everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world. This mission guides our path, and we live our values along that path.

## Mitigating Concerns

We have a page which documents our Mitigating Concerns. Many of our values help to mitigate some of these concerns.

## GitLab Values Quiz

Anyone with a GitLab account can access the GitLab Values Quiz. To participate in the quiz, you will need to complete this learning course in Level Up. If you have questions, please reach out to our L&D team at learning@gitlab.com.
