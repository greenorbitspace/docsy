# Ethical Decision Making Guidelines

## 1. Core Principles

All ethical decisions should be guided by our fundamental principles:

- Integrity - maintaining honesty and strong moral principles

- Transparency - being open about decisions and their rationale

- Fairness - ensuring equitable treatment for all stakeholders

- Responsibility - accepting accountability for decisions and their consequences

## 2. Decision-Making Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Issue

- Clearly articulate the ethical dilemma

- Determine if it conflicts with company values or policies

- Consider whether it's a legal as well as ethical issue

### Step 2: Gather Information

- Collect all relevant facts and data

- Consult applicable policies and regulations

- Document information sources

### Step 3: Stakeholder Analysis

- Identify all affected parties

- Consider short and long-term impacts

- Evaluate potential consequences for each stakeholder

### Step 4: Option Analysis

- Generate multiple possible solutions

- Evaluate each option against ethical principles

- Consider precedents and potential consequences

### Step 5: Decision Implementation

- Document the rationale for the chosen solution

- Create an implementation plan

- Communicate with affected stakeholders

### Step 6: Review and Learn

- Monitor outcomes and impacts

- Document lessons learned

- Update procedures if necessary

## 3. Additional Considerations

When making ethical decisions:

- Consult with appropriate colleagues or supervisors when uncertain

- Document all steps of the decision-making process

- Consider seeking legal counsel for complex issues

- Maintain confidentiality where appropriate

## 4. Red Flags

Watch for these warning signs that may indicate ethical concerns:

- Pressure to act quickly without proper consideration

- Requests to keep decisions or actions secret

- Conflicts with established policies or values

- Uncomfortable gut feelings about a situation

Remember: When in doubt, pause and seek guidance. It's better to take time to make the right decision than to act quickly and create ethical problems.
