description: The Responsible Procurement Impact Assessment (RPIA) evaluates procurement
  strategies against legal obligations and UKRI policies, addressing key questions
  about contract delivery, impact, and alignment with strategic objectives. High scores
  in assessments necessitate greater involvement in procurement strategy development,
  including specifications and evaluation criteria.

Each of the six themes should be considered for all procurement strategies particularly where there are legal obligations and agreed
mandated UKRI Policy. However, the extent to which each of the themes should be considered beyond what is obligated and mandated will depend the outcome of the RPIA assessment.


A number of questions will be answers in relation to the specific procurement, for example:

1. What will the contract deliver? Is it a
contract for goods, services or construction
works?

1. How will the contract be delivered?

1. What is the size, scope and scale of
contract?

1. Does the contract cover multi councils, a
single council, or an institute?

1. How critical is the product or service to
UKRI?

1. What is the impact of the contract beyond
its contractual scope on people and its
surroundings?

1. How will the contract contribute to UKRI’s
strategic objectives?

1. Does the contract meet Government and
UKRI policy directives?

1. What is the ability of particular markets
to deliver beyond the obligations and
legislation?

1. How much data is available across the
respective supply chains?

1. Does the proposed contract delivery scope
contribute to a longer-term plan to innovate
within a particular market? Does UKRI have
a strategy to develop a particular market to
be more responsible?

1. What influence and leverage does UKRI
have within the respective markets and
wider supply chains?

1. Is there a projected cost of exceeding what
is obligated and mandated? i.e. What is the
“Responsibility Premium”?


The answers to the above questions in the context of each of the themes will enable a Responsible Procurement Impact Assessment
(RPIA) to ascertain the level of responsibility UKRI will take towards respective procurement strategies. These assessments will be driven
by the UKRI Commercial team in the pre- procurement stage (directed to UK SBS for specific Common Goods and Services).


A high scoring RPIA assessment for a particular theme will trigger the requirement for more involvement from the identified Lead in development of the procurement strategy, in particular towards the following:-
a. Specification development
b. Selection and Evaluation criteria
c. Development of specific tender questions
d. Key performance indicators
e. Contract Management Plan
f. Assisting with evaluation of tenders
g. Business case contributions to the
Commercial Case (and wider)
