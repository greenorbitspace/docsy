definition: 'Resolution refers to the ability to distinguish between different features
  in data collected from various sensors. It can be categorized into four types:


  - Spatial Resolution: The smallest discernible unit on the ground, typically measured
  in meters.

  - Spectral Resolution: The ability to resolve features based on their spectral characteristics,
  often defined by the number and width of spectral bands.

  - Temporal Resolution: The frequency at which data is collected over the same area,
  indicating how often observations are made.

  - Radiometric Resolution: The sensitivity of a sensor to detect variations in energy
  levels, usually described by the number of bits used to represent the data.'
