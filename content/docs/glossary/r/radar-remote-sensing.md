definition: Radar remote sensing is a technique that uses radar signals to detect
  and characterize objects and surfaces on Earth from a distance, typically from aircraft
  or satellites. This method involves emitting microwave signals and analyzing the
  echoes returned from the target, allowing for the gathering of information about
  terrain, weather, and other environmental conditions.
