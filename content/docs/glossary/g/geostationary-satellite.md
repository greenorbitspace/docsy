definition: A geostationary satellite is an artificial satellite that is placed in
  orbit around the Earth at a height where it matches the rotational speed of the
  planet. This allows the satellite to remain fixed over a specific point on the Earth's
  surface, providing consistent communication and observation capabilities for applications
  such as weather monitoring, telecommunications, and broadcasting.
