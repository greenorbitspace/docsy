definition: The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a numerical indicator
  that uses remote sensing measurements to assess whether the target area contains
  live vegetation. It is calculated using the near-infrared and red light reflected
  by vegetation and is commonly used in agriculture, forestry, and environmental monitoring
  to evaluate plant health and biomass.
