definition: Hyperspectral imaging is a technology that captures and processes information
  from across the electromagnetic spectrum. This technique is used to identify materials,
  detect processes, and provide detailed information about the physical and chemical
  properties of objects or environments by analyzing the reflected light from them
  in many narrow spectral bands.
