definition: Albedo refers to the measure of reflectivity of a surface, specifically
  how much sunlight or radiation is reflected back into space. It is usually expressed
  as a percentage, with higher values indicating more reflectivity. In the context
  of astronomy, albedo is important for understanding the energy balance of celestial
  bodies, including planets and moons.
