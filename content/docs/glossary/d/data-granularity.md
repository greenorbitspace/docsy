definition: Data granularity refers to the level of detail or precision of data within
  a dataset. It indicates how fine or coarse the data points are, affecting the analysis
  and insights that can be derived from the data. Higher granularity means more detailed
  data, while lower granularity indicates more summarized or aggregated data.
